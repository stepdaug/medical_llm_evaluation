This clinical profile is highly characteristic of inflammatory demyelinating diseases. Multiple Sclerosis is the most statistically probable cause. Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) and MOG Antibody Disease (MOGAD) are critical differentials given the severity of the optic neuritis and brainstem involvement. Inflammatory, infectious, and neoplastic causes are less likely but must be excluded.\n\ndifferential_diagnosis = [\"Multiple Sclerosis\", \"Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD)\", \"MOG Antibody Disease (MOGAD)\", \"Neurosarcoidosis\", \"Neuro-Behcet's Disease\", \"CNS Vasculitis\", \"Brainstem Glioma\"]"
