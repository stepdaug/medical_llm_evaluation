    "response": "MRI is the gold standard to visualise the suspected demyelinating lesions and confirm dissemination in space. Serological testing for AQP4 and MOG antibodies is essential to differentiate MS from NMOSD/MOGAD, as this alters long-term management. Lumbar puncture is indicated to support an inflammatory diagnosis (oligoclonal bands). Basic bloods and vasculitis screens are required to rule out mimics and metabolic contributors.\n\ninvestigations = [\"MRI Brain and Whole Spine with contrast\", \"Full blood count\", \"Urea and electrolytes\", \"Liver function tests\", \"C-reactive protein\", \"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate\", \"Serum Glucose\", \"HbA1c\", \"Anti-AQP4 antibodies\", \"Anti-MOG antibodies\", \"Antinuclear antibodies (ANA)\", \"ANCA screen\", \"Serum ACE\", \"Syphilis serology\", \"Lyme serology\", \"Visual Evoked Potentials\", \"Lumbar Puncture (CSF analysis for oligoclonal bands, protein, glucose, cell count)\"]"
