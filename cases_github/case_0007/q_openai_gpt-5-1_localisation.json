    "response": "Left severe ptosis, dilated pupil, ophthalmoplegia and bidirectional gaze-evoked horizontal nystagmus indicate a left oculomotor fascicle lesion in the midbrain. Right-sided spastic hemiparesis with hyperreflexia, extensor plantar response, and ipsilateral limb dysmetria localise to involvement of the corticospinal tract and decussated superior cerebellar peduncle fibres in the left midbrain. A left relative afferent pupillary defect with reduced visual acuity is best explained by an additional lesion of the left optic nerve anterior to the chiasm.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"left midbrain\", \"left optic nerve\"]"
