    "response": "The clinical presentation is multifocal, indicating dissemination in space. 1. Right-sided Reduced Visual Acuity and RAPD localise to the Right Optic Nerve. 2. Left Oculomotor (CN III) palsy (ptosis, mydriasis, ophthalmoplegia) combined with contralateral (Right) hemiparesis and contralateral (Right) cerebellar ataxia is characteristic of Benedikt's Syndrome, localising to the Left Midbrain tegmentum. 3. Left hemi-sensory loss (affecting both spinothalamic and dorsal column modalities) implies a lesion in the Right Brainstem (medial lemniscus/spinothalamic tract) or Right Thalamocortical pathways. 4. Primary position downbeat nystagmus localises to the cervicomedullary junction or vestibulocerebellum.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Right Optic Nerve\", \"Left Midbrain\", \"Right Brainstem\", \"Cervicomedullary Junction\"]"
