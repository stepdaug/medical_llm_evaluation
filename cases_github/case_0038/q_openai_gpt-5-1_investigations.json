    "response": "Urgent neuroimaging and vascular imaging are required to confirm a left midbrain lesion, distinguish ischaemia from haemorrhage, and identify treatable large-vessel occlusion. Cardiac and metabolic workup helps define stroke mechanism and exclude mimics. If imaging suggests non-vascular pathology, further MRI and CSF studies are needed to evaluate demyelinating, inflammatory, or neoplastic causes.\n\ninvestigations = [\"MRI brain with diffusion-weighted imaging and MR angiography of intracranial vessels\", \"Non-contrast CT brain\", \"CT angiogram of head and neck\", \"MRI of cervical spine and craniocervical junction\", \"ECG\", \"Continuous cardiac telemetry\", \"Transthoracic echocardiogram\", \"Full blood count\", \"Urea and electrolytes\", \"Liver function tests\", \"Blood glucose\", \"Coagulation screen\", \"Lipid profile\", \"HbA1c\", \"C-reactive protein\", \"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate\", \"Serum vitamin B12\", \"Serum folate\", \"Thyroid function tests\", \"Antinuclear antibody\", \"Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody\", \"Lumbar puncture with CSF cell count, protein, glucose, oligoclonal bands, and microbiology (after imaging excludes mass effect and acute haemorrhage)\"]"
