    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** Admission to high-dependency neurology or stroke unit with frequent neurological observations and optimisation of airway, breathing and circulation\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Brainstem involvement risks rapid neurological deterioration and respiratory compromise Allows urgent imaging, blood pressure management and early complication detection\n\n*   **Treatment:** Symptomatic management of diplopia with eye patch or temporary occlusion\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Reduces distressing diplopia and improves mobility and safety while definitive treatment is planned\n\n*   **Treatment:** Reperfusion therapy for ischaemic stroke (intravenous alteplase and/or mechanical thrombectomy)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Must only be given after imaging confirms an acute ischaemic midbrain infarct without haemorrhage or large aneurysm Requires known time of onset and assessment of standard thrombolysis and thrombectomy contraindications\n\n*   **Treatment:** Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin followed by long-term single antiplatelet and high-intensity statin if ischaemic stroke is confirmed\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Initiation should follow exclusion of intracranial haemorrhage or surgery-requiring aneurysm on imaging Used for secondary prevention once a vascular aetiology is established\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone followed by short oral taper for acute demyelinating relapse\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Should be started after MRI and CSF support an inflammatory demyelinating diagnosis and infection is excluded Aims to hasten recovery of optic nerve and brainstem function rather than alter long-term prognosis\n\n*   **Treatment:** Initiation of long-term disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Requires firm diagnosis of multiple sclerosis using McDonald criteria and discussion of drug risks and benefits Choice of agent depends on lesion burden, relapse history and comorbidities\n\n*   **Treatment:** Early multidisciplinary neurorehabilitation and venous thromboembolism prophylaxis\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Left hemiparesis and gait unsteadiness warrant prompt physiotherapy and occupational therapy to maximise recovery and independence Immobility increases risk of deep vein thrombosis, so mechanical and pharmacological prophylaxis should begin once intracranial haemorrhage is excluded\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"Admission to high-dependency neurology or stroke unit with
