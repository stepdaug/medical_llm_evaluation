    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** Airway, breathing and circulation stabilisation with supplemental oxygen if needed, IV access and continuous monitoring\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Brainstem lesions can unpredictably compromise consciousness and respiratory drive Optimising oxygenation and perfusion limits secondary brain injury Physiological stability is required before and during urgent imaging and interventions\n\n*   **Treatment:** Urgent admission to a hyperacute stroke unit or intensive care setting\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Suspected posterior-circulation stroke needs close neurological and cardiorespiratory observation Early specialist stroke care is associated with better functional outcomes Facilitates rapid coordination of imaging and reperfusion therapies\n\n*   **Treatment:** Assessment for and administration of intravenous thrombolysis (alteplase) if eligibility criteria are met\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Intravenous thrombolysis is highly time dependent for acute ischaemic stroke Posterior-circulation infarcts can benefit substantially from early recanalisation Imaging and contraindication screening for thrombolysis must begin immediately at presentation\n\n*   **Treatment:** Assessment for and performance of mechanical thrombectomy if a treatable large-vessel occlusion is identified\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Basilar or proximal posterior cerebral artery occlusions are amenable to thrombectomy Brainstem strokes carry high morbidity and mortality without recanalisation Endovascular therapy is most effective when arranged rapidly after vascular imaging\n\n*   **Treatment:** Aspirin 300 mg once daily followed by 75\u2013100 mg daily (or alternative antiplatelet regimen) for confirmed non-cardioembolic ischaemic stroke\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Antiplatelet therapy should begin only after intracranial haemorrhage is excluded on imaging If intravenous thrombolysis is used, aspirin is delayed for 24 hours to reduce haemorrhagic transformation risk\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-intensity statin therapy (e.g., atorvastatin 80 mg daily)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Initiated after safe oral or enteral administration is established High-intensity statins reduce risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke and other vascular events\n\n*   **Treatment:** Early multidisciplinary neurorehabilitation including physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy with formal swallow assessment\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Started once medically stable, typically within 24\u201348 hours, to maximise neurological recovery Addresses hemiparesis, spasticity, ataxia and dysarthria Swallow assessment minimises aspiration risk and guides nutrition and hydration plans\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone followed by an oral taper if imaging demonstrates an inflammatory or demyelinating midbrain lesion\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Corticosteroids are first-line therapy for acute demyelinating brainstem lesions such as multiple sclerosis relapses Should only be commenced after vascular and infectious causes have been excluded to avoid masking alternative diagnoses or worsening infection\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"Airway, breathing and circulation stabilisation
