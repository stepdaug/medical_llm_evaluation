    "response": "The patient presents with a triad of signs indicating dissemination in space within the central nervous system. 1) Severe reduction in right visual acuity (6/60) combined with a Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect (RAPD) localises to the right optic nerve. 2) Weakness in right hip and knee flexion (4+/5) with preserved extension follows a pyramidal distribution, implicating the corticospinal tract supplying the right leg (located in the left hemisphere/brainstem or right spinal cord). 3) An isolated brisk left supinator reflex (3+) indicates upper motor neuron disinhibition affecting the C5/C6 segment on the left, implicating the corticospinal tract supplying the left arm. The combination of optic neuropathy and bilateral motor signs is classic for a multifocal inflammatory process.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"right optic nerve\", \"bilateral corticospinal tracts\"]"
