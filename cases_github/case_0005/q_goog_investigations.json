    "response": "The investigation strategy aims to confirm the presence of multifocal central nervous system lesions, establish evidence for dissemination in space and time to support a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS), and crucially, to exclude important alternative diagnoses, particularly other inflammatory demyelinating conditions like NMOSD and MOGAD, which have different treatments and prognoses.\n\nThe highest priority is neuroimaging. An MRI of the brain, orbits, and the entire spinal cord with gadolinium contrast is the single most important investigation. It will visualise the suspected lesions in the right cerebellum and left optic nerve, and identify other clinically silent lesions, which would provide evidence of dissemination in space. Gadolinium enhancement would indicate active inflammation, supporting dissemination in time.\n\nSimultaneously, blood tests are essential to rule out MS mimics. Specific antibody testing for Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) and Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein (MOG) is critical, as positive results would diagnose NMOSD or MOGAD, respectively. A broader screen for systemic inflammatory, infectious, and metabolic causes is also warranted.\n\nIf the diagnosis remains uncertain after imaging and blood tests, a lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is the next step. The presence of CSF-specific oligoclonal bands is a key supportive criterion for MS. Finally, visual evoked potentials can provide objective electrophysiological evidence of demyelination in the optic pathways, which can be useful to confirm a clinically silent lesion.\n\ninvestigations = [\"MRI of Brain, Orbits, and full Spine with gadolinium contrast\", \"Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) Antibody Test\", \"Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein (MOG) Antibody Test\", \"Lumbar Puncture for CSF analysis (including cell count, protein, glucose, oligoclonal bands, and IgG index)\", \"Full Blood Count\", \"Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate\", \"C-Reactive Protein\", \"Antinuclear Antibody\", \"Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme\", \"Vitamin B12\", \"Syphilis Serology\", \"HIV Serology\", \"Visual Evoked Potentials\"]",
