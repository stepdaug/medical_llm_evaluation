    "response": "My choice of investigations is prioritised to urgently confirm the anatomical lesions, identify evidence of inflammation, and differentiate between the most likely causes, which are multifocal inflammatory demyelinating diseases.\n\nThe highest priority is an MRI of the brain and spine with contrast. This will visualise the lesions in the left midbrain and optic nerve, assess for active inflammation (contrast enhancement), and search for additional, clinically silent lesions that would establish dissemination in space\u2014a key feature of diseases like MS.\n\nSimultaneously, specific blood tests for Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (AQP4-IgG) and MOG Antibody Disease (MOG-IgG) are critical, as a positive result for either would establish a specific diagnosis and dramatically alter management compared to MS. A lumbar puncture is also essential to analyse the cerebrospinal fluid for oligoclonal bands and an elevated IgG index, which are supportive of MS, and to rule out infectious or malignant causes.\n\nThe remaining investigations serve as a broader screen for systemic inflammatory mimics (e.g., sarcoidosis, vasculitis, connective tissue disease) and infectious causes, which are less likely but important to exclude. Visual evoked potentials are included to provide objective physiological evidence of optic nerve dysfunction.\n\ninvestigations = [\"MRI Brain with Gadolinium Contrast\", \"MRI Spine (Cervical and Thoracic) with Gadolinium Contrast\", \"Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) Antibody Titer\", \"Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein (MOG) Antibody Titer\", \"Lumbar Puncture with CSF Analysis (including Oligoclonal Bands and IgG Index)\", \"Full Blood Count\", \"Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate\", \"C-Reactive Protein\", \"Urea and Electrolytes\", \"Liver Function Tests\", \"Antinuclear Antibody\", \"Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Level\", \"Syphilis Serology\", \"HIV Serology\", \"Visual Evoked Potentials\"]",
