    "response": "Left reduced acuity with RAPD indicates a pre-chiasmal optic neuropathy. Marked right-sided limb and gait ataxia with gaze-evoked horizontal nystagmus and a negative Romberg localise to the right cerebellar hemisphere. Right leg-predominant spasticity, pyramidal weakness, brisk reflexes with extensor plantar response, and impaired sensation in the right lower limb indicate involvement of right-sided long tracts within the cervical spinal cord. In a young woman this multifocal central pattern is most consistent with disseminated inflammatory demyelination.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"left optic nerve\", \"right cerebellar hemisphere\", \"right cervical spinal cord\"]"
