    "response": "The patient presents with a 'crossed' brainstem syndrome characterised by ipsilateral cranial nerve deficits and contralateral long tract signs. Specifically, there is a Left VI nerve palsy (abduction deficit) and Left VII nerve lower motor neuron facial weakness, localising to the left pons. The presence of left-sided cerebellar signs (ataxia, dysmetria) confirms involvement of the left cerebellar peduncles. Concurrently, right-sided hemiparesis (with spasticity and hyperreflexia) and right-sided hemisensory loss indicate involvement of the left corticospinal tract and left medial lemniscus/spinothalamic tracts, respectively. The 'acid taste' (dysgeusia) is consistent with involvement of the gustatory fibers associated with the facial nerve or solitary tract.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Left Pons\"]"
