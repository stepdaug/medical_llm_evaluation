    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** Swallow assessment and aspiration precautions (including modified diet, thickened fluids or nasogastric feeding as needed)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Palatal and tongue weakness from left lower cranial nerve involvement increase aspiration risk Patient has a cough that may be aspiration-related Early swallow management prevents aspiration pneumonia and ensures adequate nutrition and hydration\n\n*   **Treatment:** Physiotherapy and occupational therapy for gait and balance rehabilitation, with provision of walking aids as required\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Gait is unsteady with tandem instability and left upper limb dysmetria Early rehabilitation reduces falls risk and deconditioning Helps patient adapt to right-sided spastic weakness and improve functional independence\n\n*   **Treatment:** Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin and compression stockings\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Right-sided spastic weakness and impaired mobility increase risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism Neurological inpatients with reduced mobility routinely require pharmacological thromboprophylaxis unless contraindicated\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\u20135 days\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Intended to treat a suspected acute inflammatory demyelinating lesion of the brainstem and optic nerve Should be started promptly once MRI excludes mass lesion, abscess or large infarction and supports demyelination High-dose steroids accelerate recovery from acute demyelinating attacks but are not given before basic imaging\n\n*   **Treatment:** Oral prednisolone taper following intravenous methylprednisolone\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Introduced after completion of IV steroid course to reduce risk of rebound symptoms Requires assessment of contraindications such as diabetes control and peptic ulcer disease\n\n*   **Treatment:** Initiation of disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis (e.g. ocrelizumab, natalizumab or interferon-beta according to local protocol)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Requires confirmation of multiple sclerosis with MRI and CSF oligoclonal bands demonstrating dissemination in space and time Pre-treatment screening for infections and detailed counselling about risks, benefits and family planning are necessary\n\n*   **Treatment:** Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 300 mg daily\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Reserved for initiation if MRI and vascular imaging demonstrate an ischaemic medullary infarct rather than demyelination Avoids unnecessary bleeding risk before the aetiology of the brainstem lesion is established\n\n*   **Treatment:** Management of spasticity with agents such as oral baclofen or tizanidine\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Right-sided spasticity is mild and may improve with treatment of the underlying lesion and physiotherapy alone Antispastic medications can cause additional weakness and sedation, so introduction is best deferred until the neurological picture stabilises\n\n*   **Treatment:** Proton pump inhibitor prophylaxis during any high-dose corticosteroid course\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Should commence concurrently with steroid therapy once that is started Reduces risk of steroid-associated gastritis, peptic ulceration and gastrointestinal bleeding\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"Swallow assessment and
