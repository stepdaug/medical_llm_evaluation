    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** Admission under neurology with close neurological observation and early mobilisation\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Significant brainstem involvement with gait unsteadiness and hemiparesis requires inpatient monitoring for deterioration Facilitates rapid completion of MRI, lumbar puncture, and other investigations Allows early engagement of rehabilitation services\n\n*   **Treatment:** Intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\u20135 days\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Clinical picture strongly suggests acute inflammatory demyelination affecting brainstem and optic nerve High-dose IV steroids shorten duration and severity of demyelinating relapses Baseline observations, blood tests, and CXR show no evidence of systemic infection or major contraindication\n\n*   **Treatment:** Oral prednisolone taper following IV methylprednisolone\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Instituted after completion of IV course to reduce risk of rebound symptoms Dose and duration should be individualised once response to IV therapy is assessed\n\n*   **Treatment:** Proton pump inhibitor during high-dose steroid therapy\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Reduces risk of steroid-induced gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding Patient will receive several days of high-dose corticosteroids\n\n*   **Treatment:** Thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin and graduated compression stockings\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Left hemiparesis and reduced mobility increase risk of venous thromboembolism Hospital admission and high-dose steroids further elevate thrombotic risk\n\n*   **Treatment:** Physiotherapy and occupational therapy for gait training and limb weakness\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Early rehabilitation improves functional recovery in demyelinating and brainstem lesions Helps prevent contractures and secondary complications from spasticity and weakness Assists with safety assessment and equipment needs prior to discharge\n\n*   **Treatment:** Initiation of disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis (agent selected according to risk profile and local guidelines)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Requires confirmation of diagnosis using MRI and CSF results against McDonald criteria Choice of first-line versus high-efficacy therapy depends on lesion burden, relapse severity, and patient preference Baseline infection screening and counselling are needed before starting long-term immunotherapy\n\n*   **Treatment:** Management of persistent spasticity with oral agents such as baclofen or tizanidine\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Spasticity may partially resolve after acute relapse treatment Medication should be titrated based on residual symptoms and impact on function during follow-up\n\n*   **Treatment:** Symptomatic management of neuropathic pain with agents such as gabapentin, pregabalin, or amitriptyline if required\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Current sensory findings may not be painful but neuropathic pain can emerge later Therapy should be tailored to symptom severity and comorbidities\n\n*   **Treatment:** Speech and language therapy assessment if swallowing or speech difficulties develop\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** No current bulbar symptoms, but brainstem lesions carry a risk of emerging dysphagia or dysarthria Early involvement is warranted if any bulbar dysfunction appears\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\":
