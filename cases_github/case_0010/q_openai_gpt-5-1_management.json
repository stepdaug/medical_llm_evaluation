    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (e.g., 1 g daily for 3\u20135 days) followed by an oral steroid taper\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Subacute monocular visual loss with right RAPD consistent with inflammatory optic neuritis Objective evidence of a concurrent central sensorimotor lesion suggesting active inflammatory demyelination Early corticosteroid therapy hastens recovery in optic neuritis and myelitis and may limit permanent deficit To be initiated immediately after MRI excludes compressive, haemorrhagic or infectious lesions\n\n*   **Treatment:** Proton pump inhibitor and gastric protection while receiving high-dose corticosteroids\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** High-dose systemic steroids increase risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and dyspepsia Prophylaxis reduces steroid-related gastric complications\n\n*   **Treatment:** Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin and mechanical measures as appropriate\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Right leg weakness and gait unsteadiness reduce mobility, increasing VTE risk High-dose steroids may further increase thrombotic risk\n\n*   **Treatment:** Physiotherapy and gait/balance rehabilitation\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Right lower limb spastic weakness and sensory ataxia predispose to falls Early rehabilitation improves functional outcome and mobility Helps manage spasticity and optimises walking pattern\n\n*   **Treatment:** Optimisation of diabetes control and vascular risk factor management\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Type 2 diabetes increases risk of additional microvascular optic and CNS events Good glycaemic and blood pressure control supports neurological recovery and reduces future risk\n\n*   **Treatment:** Plasma exchange for steroid-refractory optic neuritis or myelitis\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Reserved for cases with poor response to first-line high-dose steroids Particularly important if NMOSD or MOGAD is confirmed or strongly suspected Requires availability of specialised resources and confirmation of diagnosis\n\n*   **Treatment:** Disease-modifying therapy for an inflammatory demyelinating disease (e.g., multiple sclerosis or NMOSD-specific immunotherapy)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Choice of agent depends on definitive diagnosis from MRI, CSF and serology Needs detailed risk\u2013benefit discussion and baseline safety screening Not appropriate to start before establishing whether this is MS, NMOSD, MOGAD or another condition\n\n*   **Treatment:** Vitamin B12 replacement if deficiency is identified\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** B12 deficiency can mimic or contribute to myelopathy and sensory ataxia Replacement is only indicated if laboratory testing confirms deficiency\n\n*   **Treatment:** Regular ophthalmology follow-up and visual rehabilitation where needed\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Visual outcome and need for further intervention can only be assessed after acute treatment Vision aids and rehabilitation are tailored to residual deficits\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (e.g., 1 g daily for 3\\u20135 days) followed by an oral steroid taper\", \"timing\": \"Start Now\", \"reasons\":
