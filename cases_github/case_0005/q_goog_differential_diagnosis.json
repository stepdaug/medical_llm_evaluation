    "response": "The clinical presentation is characterized by evidence of at least two distinct lesions within the central nervous system, a hallmark of a demyelinating disease. The patient is a 41-year-old female, fitting the typical demographic for such conditions. The first lesion is a left optic neuropathy, confirmed by reduced visual acuity and a left relative afferent pupillary defect. The second is a right-sided cerebellar syndrome, evidenced by ipsilateral appendicular ataxia (dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesia), gait ataxia, and rebound nystagmus. This dissemination of lesions in both time and space is the classic presentation for Multiple Sclerosis. Other inflammatory conditions that can present with multifocal CNS deficits, particularly optic neuritis, must also be considered.\n\n1.  **Multiple Sclerosis (MS):** This is the most probable diagnosis. It perfectly explains the combination of a left optic neuritis and a separate demyelinating lesion in the right cerebellar hemisphere or its pathways, causing the ipsilateral signs. The patient's age and sex are classic for MS onset.\n\n2.  **Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD):** This is an important differential for any patient presenting with optic neuritis. While NMOSD classically involves the optic nerves and spinal cord, brainstem and cerebellar syndromes can also occur. It is crucial to differentiate from MS as treatments differ significantly.\n\n3.  **MOG Antibody Disease (MOGAD):** Another antibody-mediated inflammatory demyelinating disease that frequently presents with optic neuritis. Cerebellar and brainstem involvement is also well-described, making it a key differential diagnosis that must be excluded with serological testing.\n\n4.  **Neurosarcoidosis:** This systemic granulomatous disease is a well-known mimic of MS. It can cause multifocal inflammatory lesions anywhere in the CNS, including the optic nerves and cerebellum, and should be considered in the differential for multifocal neurological deficits.\n\ndifferential_diagnosis = [\"Multiple Sclerosis\", \"Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder\", \"MOG Antibody Disease\", \"Neurosarcoidosis\"]",
