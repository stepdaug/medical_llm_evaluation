    "response": "My clinical reasoning is as follows: The patient's examination reveals a combination of bilateral long tract signs and multiple, predominantly right-sided, brainstem signs.\n\nThe bilateral spasticity, hyperreflexia, clonus, upgoing plantar responses, and mild weakness constitute an upper motor neuron syndrome affecting all four limbs. The bilateral loss of vibration and joint position sense indicates disruption of the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathways. Together, these bilateral findings point to a single lesion affecting these tracts in the brainstem or high cervical spinal cord.\n\nThe presence of multiple cranial nerve and cerebellar signs localises the lesion definitively to the brainstem. Specifically:\n1.  Right-sided palatal weakness (CN IX/X) and right-sided tongue weakness (CN XII) localise to the right medulla oblongata.\n2.  A right-sided Horner's syndrome (mild ptosis and miosis) indicates a lesion of the descending sympathetic tract on the right, which passes through the medulla.\n3.  Right-sided appendicular ataxia (dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesia) and gaze-evoked nystagmus are explained by involvement of the right inferior cerebellar peduncle and vestibulocerebellar connections within the medulla.\n\nTo account for all findings, the most parsimonious explanation is a single, large lesion centered in the medulla oblongata. This lesion must affect the right side to explain the unilateral cranial nerve and cerebellar signs, but also extend across the midline to involve the bilateral corticospinal tracts (pyramids) and medial lemnisci.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Bilateral Medulla Oblongata\"]",
