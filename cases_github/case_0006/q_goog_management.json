    "response": "1.  **Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n2.  **Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n    *   **Treatment:** High-Dose Intravenous Methylprednisolone\n    *   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n    *   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** The patient is presenting with an acute, clinically significant neurological event causing disability (unsteady gait, weakness). High-dose corticosteroids are the standard of care to reduce the inflammation associated with this acute demyelinating relapse. Prompt initiation is crucial to shorten the duration of the attack, hasten functional recovery, and potentially reduce the severity of residual deficits.\n\n    *   **Treatment:** Disease-Modifying Therapy (DMT)\n    *   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n    *   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** While long-term DMT is indicated, the specific choice is critically dependent on the final diagnosis. The treatments for multiple sclerosis can be ineffective or even harmful in mimics like neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) or neurosarcoidosis. Therefore, it is essential to delay the initiation of a DMT until the results of key investigations (MRI, lumbar puncture, AQP4/MOG serology, and sarcoidosis workup) are available to establish a definitive diagnosis.\n\n    *   **Treatment:** Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy\n    *   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n    *   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** The patient has significant functional deficits, including gait instability, weakness, and incoordination. Early and concurrent rehabilitation is essential to maximize motor recovery, improve balance, teach compensatory strategies, ensure safety, and maintain functional independence. This can begin immediately, alongside acute medical treatment.\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"High-Dose Intravenous Methylprednisolone\", \"timing\": \"Start Now\", \"reasons\": [\"The patient is experiencing an acute, disabling neurological relapse.\", \"Prompt treatment is required to reduce inflammation and hasten functional recovery.\"]}, {\"treatment\": \"Disease-Modifying Therapy\", \"timing\": \"Delay\", \"reasons\": [\"The definitive diagnosis is not yet confirmed, and key mimics like NMOSD and neurosarcoidosis must be ruled out.\", \"The choice of DMT is highly dependent on the final diagnosis, as incorrect therapy can be ineffective or harmful.\"]}, {\"treatment\": \"Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy\", \"timing\": \"Start Now\", \"reasons\": [\"The patient has significant functional deficits affecting gait, balance, and coordination.\", \"Early rehabilitation is critical to maximize functional recovery and ensure safety.\"]}]",
