    "response": "The clinical presentation reveals two distinct sites of pathology. First, the severe visual loss in the left eye combined with a Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect (RAPD) indicates a pre-chiasmal lesion of the Left Optic Nerve. Second, the combination of a Left Oculomotor (CN III) palsy (ptosis, mydriasis, ophthalmoplegia) with contralateral (Right) hemiparesis, hemi-sensory loss, and hemi-ataxia represents a classic 'crossed brainstem syndrome' (specifically Weber's or Benedikt's syndrome). This localises to the Left Midbrain, involving the CN III fascicles, cerebral peduncle, medial lemniscus, and red nucleus. The downbeat nystagmus suggests additional involvement of the vestibulocerebellar pathways, common in multifocal demyelination.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Left Optic Nerve\", \"Left Midbrain\"]"
