    "response": "The focal crossed brainstem syndrome with acute headache in a 58-year-old most strongly suggests a vascular event in the left midbrain; haemorrhage or cavernoma must be excluded urgently. Demyelination, neoplasm, and other inflammatory conditions are alternative causes of a midbrain lesion but are less likely given age, normal inflammatory markers, and absence of systemic features, while complicated migraine could mimic symptoms but would not persistently produce objective UMN and cerebellar signs.\n\ndifferential_diagnosis = [\"Left midbrain ischaemic stroke (Benedikt/Weber-type brainstem syndrome)\", \"Left midbrain haemorrhage or cavernous malformation\", \"Demyelinating brainstem lesion (e.g., multiple sclerosis)\", \"Intrinsic brainstem tumour (e.g., midbrain glioma) or metastatic lesion\", \"Complicated migraine with brainstem aura\"]"
