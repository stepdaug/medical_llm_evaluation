    "response": "The patient presents with signs of multifocal CNS dysfunction separated in anatomical space. Firstly, the left-sided reduced visual acuity (6/24), combined with a Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect (RAPD), localises to the left anterior visual pathway (optic nerve). Secondly, the cluster of slurred speech (dysarthria), ataxic gait, right-beating nystagmus, and strictly right-sided appendicular ataxia (dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesia) localises to the right cerebellum. The preservation of cranial nerves III-XII (except optic) and lack of crossed signs makes a brainstem lesion less likely than a discrete cerebellar lesion.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Left Optic Nerve\", \"Right Cerebellar Hemisphere\"]"
