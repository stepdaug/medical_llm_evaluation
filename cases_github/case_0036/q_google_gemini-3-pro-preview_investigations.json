    "response": "Urgent neuro-imaging is required to differentiate between inflammatory (enhancement) and compressive causes. Serological testing is critical to distinguish between typical demyelination and antibody-mediated diseases (NMO/MOG) which carry a higher risk of relapse and require different management. Vascular and infectious screens are necessary to rule out mimics.\n\ninvestigations = [\"MRI Brain and Orbits with Gadolinium\", \"Aquaporin-4 antibodies (NMO-IgG)\", \"Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein (MOG) antibodies\", \"Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)\", \"C-Reactive Protein\", \"Full blood count\", \"Urea and electrolytes\", \"Liver function tests\", \"HbA1c\", \"Syphilis serology (VDRL/TPHA)\", \"Lyme disease serology\", \"Autoimmune screen (ANA, ANCA)\", \"Vitamin B12 and Folate\", \"Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)\", \"Visual Field Testing (Perimetry)\"]"
