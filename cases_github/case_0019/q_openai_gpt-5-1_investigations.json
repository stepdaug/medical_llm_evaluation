    "response": "Urgent MRI of the spine (and brain) is needed to confirm a thoracic myelopathy, define its extent, and exclude surgically treatable compression. Blood tests should prioritise reversible metabolic causes such as vitamin B12 and copper deficiency and screen for infectious (HIV, syphilis, HTLV-1) and systemic autoimmune aetiologies. CSF analysis and specific antibodies help identify inflammatory demyelinating disorders. Nerve conduction studies are considered if coexistent peripheral neuropathy is suspected. Additional investigations address the chest consolidation and general medical status.\n\ninvestigations = [\"MRI of cervical and thoracic spine with gadolinium\", \"MRI of brain with gadolinium\", \"Full blood count\", \"Urea and electrolytes\", \"Liver function tests\", \"C-reactive protein\", \"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate\", \"Serum vitamin B12 level\", \"Serum methylmalonic acid level\", \"Serum homocysteine level\", \"Serum folate level\", \"Intrinsic factor antibody\", \"Parietal cell antibody\", \"Serum copper level\", \"Serum ceruloplasmin level\", \"HIV antigen/antibody test\", \"Syphilis serology (treponemal and non-treponemal tests)\", \"HTLV-1 antibody test\", \"Thyroid-stimulating hormone\", \"Vitamin E level\", \"Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation\", \"Antinuclear antibody\", \"Extractable nuclear antigen panel\", \"Aquaporin-4 IgG antibody\", \"Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) IgG antibody\", \"Lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid analysis including cell count, protein, glucose, oligoclonal bands, and infectious PCR\", \"Nerve conduction studies and electromyography\", \"Repeat chest X-ray or CT chest with contrast to characterise the consolidation\", \"Blood cultures\"]"
