    "response": "A focal lesion at the right cervicomedullary junction producing ipsilateral lower-cranial-nerve and cerebellar signs with bilateral pyramidal and dorsal column involvement is most likely due to a structural mass or primary CNS inflammatory process. The young age favours intrinsic glioma or demyelinating disease, while the chronic-appearing spasticity and absence of marked systemic inflammation make acute infection or infarction less likely; congenital malformations and extra-axial tumours are important alternatives.\n\ndifferential_diagnosis = [\"Intrinsic cervicomedullary junction glioma (e.g., low-grade astrocytoma or ependymoma)\", \"Multiple sclerosis with brainstem and cervical spinal cord plaques\", \"Foramen magnum meningioma causing right cervicomedullary compression\", \"Chiari I malformation with cervicomedullary crowding and syringobulbia\", \"Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder with cervicomedullary involvement\", \"Tuberculous granuloma or other infectious mass lesion at the cervicomedullary junction\"]"
