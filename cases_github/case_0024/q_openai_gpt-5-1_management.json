    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\u20135 days\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Standard first-line therapy for acute demyelinating optic neuritis and myelitis Aims to hasten visual and motor recovery and limit cord damage Systemic infection appears unlikely given normal temperature, CRP and WCC\n\n*   **Treatment:** Oral prednisolone taper for 2\u20134 weeks following IV steroids\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Commence after completion of IV pulse to prevent rebound symptoms Dose and duration adjusted according to response and final diagnosis\n\n*   **Treatment:** Plasma exchange (5\u20137 exchanges over 10\u201314 days)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Reserved for severe or rapidly progressive deficits not improving within several days of IV steroids Particularly important if NMOSD or MOG-antibody-associated disease is confirmed or strongly suspected\n\n*   **Treatment:** Disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis (e.g. ocrelizumab or other high-efficacy agent as per local protocol)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Initiate after diagnostic criteria for MS are fulfilled on MRI and CSF Requires exclusion of NMOSD/MOGAD and assessment of comorbidities and infection risk Needs detailed counselling and shared decision-making\n\n*   **Treatment:** Long-term immunosuppressive therapy for NMOSD (e.g. rituximab, satralizumab or inebilizumab) if NMOSD confirmed\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Choice of agent depends on AQP4 status and specialist input Started only once NMOSD diagnosis is secure because some MS therapies can worsen NMOSD\n\n*   **Treatment:** Physiotherapy and gait rehabilitation\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Right leg weakness and spasticity are already impairing gait and balance Early mobilisation reduces deconditioning and promotes neuroplastic recovery\n\n*   **Treatment:** Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin and compression stockings\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Lower-limb weakness and reduced mobility increase venous thromboembolism risk Prophylaxis is recommended in acute myelopathy until mobility improves\n\n*   **Treatment:** Neuropathic pain management with agents such as gabapentin or amitriptyline if sensory symptoms are painful\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Band-like chest dysaesthesia and limb paraesthesia can be distressing and limit rehabilitation Early symptom control improves sleep, mood and participation in therapy\n\n*   **Treatment:** Gastric protection with a proton pump inhibitor during high-dose steroid therapy\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** High-dose corticosteroids increase risk of gastritis and peptic ulceration Patient will receive several days of IV and oral steroids\n\n*   **Treatment:** Vitamin D supplementation and lifestyle advice (smoking cessation, exercise) if demyelinating disease confirmed\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Supportive long-term measures that may modify disease course in MS Can be initiated electively after diagnosis and baseline levels are checked\n\n*   **Treatment:** Occupational therapy assessment and home safety review\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Plan once early response to treatment is known and residual deficits are clearer Aims to optimise independence and reduce falls risk if gait impairment persists\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\":
