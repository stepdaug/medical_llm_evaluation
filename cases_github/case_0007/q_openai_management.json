target <130/80 longer term)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Hypertension is a key stroke risk factor Secondary prevention benefit irrespective of baseline BP if tolerated\n\n*   **Treatment:** Intermittent pneumatic compression for DVT prophylaxis\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Reduced mobility with hemiparesis increases VTE risk Safe prior to confirming stroke subtype\n\n*   **Treatment:** Eye care for third-nerve palsy (lubricating drops/ointment, eyelid taping at night, temporary occlusion/patch for diplopia)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Prevents exposure keratopathy Improves function while palsy recovers\n\n*   **Treatment:** Physiotherapy and occupational therapy for gait and arm ataxia/weakness;
