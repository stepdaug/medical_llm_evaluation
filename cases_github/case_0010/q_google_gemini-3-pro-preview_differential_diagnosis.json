    "response": "The combination of optic neuritis and transverse myelitis (specifically a Brown-S\u00e9quard presentation) suggests an inflammatory demyelinating aetiology. Multiple Sclerosis is the most probable diagnosis given the demographics and clinical phenotype. However, Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) and MOG Antibody Disease (MOGAD) are critical differentials that present similarly with optic nerve and spinal cord involvement. Neurosarcoidosis and infectious causes (e.g., Lyme, Syphilis) are less common but possible mimics. Structural compression (e.g., meningioma) could explain the cord lesion but not the optic nerve finding.\n\ndifferential_diagnosis = [\"Multiple Sclerosis\", \"Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD)\", \"MOG Antibody Disease (MOGAD)\", \"Neurosarcoidosis\", \"Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM)\", \"Spinal Cord Neoplasm\", \"Systemic Lupus Erythematosus with CNS involvement\"]"
