    "response": "A young man with subacute onset has (1) right monocular visual loss with RAPD, indicating a right optic nerve lesion; (2) ipsilateral complete third nerve palsy with severe ptosis, dilated pupil, vertical nystagmus and contralateral left limb ataxia, best localised to a right midbrain tegmental lesion involving the oculomotor fascicle and decussated cerebellar pathways; and (3) bilateral pyramidal signs with spastic paraparesis and impaired proprioception/vibration below the neck with positive Romberg, suggesting a separate lesion in the cervical spinal cord affecting dorsal columns and long motor pathways. The pattern is therefore multifocal within the CNS.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"right optic nerve\", \"right midbrain tegmentum\", \"bilateral cervical spinal cord\"]"
