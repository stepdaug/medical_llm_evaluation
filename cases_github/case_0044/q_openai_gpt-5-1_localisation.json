    "response": "Left-sided limb dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesia and ataxic gait with normal tone, power and reflexes indicate an ipsilateral cerebellar lesion, and primary-position downbeat nystagmus is typical of vestibulocerebellar/cervicomedullary involvement. Reduced left visual acuity with a left RAPD and otherwise normal ocular motility localise an additional afferent lesion anterior to the chiasm in the left optic nerve.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"left cerebellum\", \"left optic nerve\"]"
