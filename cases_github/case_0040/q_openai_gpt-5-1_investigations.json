    "response": "Imaging of the brain, orbits and spinal cord is required urgently to define the central lesions, distinguish demyelinating, vascular and compressive causes, and guide acute treatment. Neurophysiology will characterise the peripheral neuropathy. Blood tests should search for reversible myeloneuropathies (especially vitamin B12 and copper deficiency) and systemic autoimmune, metabolic or infectious causes. CSF and antibody studies help confirm or exclude inflammatory demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica. Vascular investigations are included because a parasagittal infarct remains a differential.\n\ninvestigations = [\"MRI of brain and entire spinal cord with gadolinium\", \"MRI of orbits with gadolinium\", \"Nerve conduction studies and electromyography\", \"Visual evoked potentials\", \"Lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid analysis including cell count, protein, glucose and oligoclonal bands\", \"Full blood count\", \"Serum vitamin B12 level\", \"Serum methylmalonic acid\", \"Serum homocysteine\", \"Serum folate level\", \"Serum copper level\", \"Serum ceruloplasmin\", \"Urea and electrolytes\", \"Liver function tests\", \"C-reactive protein\", \"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate\", \"Fasting blood glucose\", \"HbA1c\", \"Thyroid function tests\", \"Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation\", \"Serum vitamin E level\", \"Antinuclear antibody\", \"Extractable nuclear antigen panel\", \"Double-stranded DNA antibody\", \"Antiphospholipid antibodies\", \"Serum aquaporin-4 antibody\", \"Serum MOG antibody\", \"HIV serology\", \"Syphilis serology (e.g., VDRL and TPPA)\", \"ECG\", \"Transthoracic echocardiogram\", \"Carotid and vertebral duplex ultrasound\"]"
