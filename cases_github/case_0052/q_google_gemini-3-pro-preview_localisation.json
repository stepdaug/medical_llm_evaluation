    "response": "The patient presents with left-sided visual acuity loss (6/24), 'smudge' sensation, and a Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect (RAPD), which unequivocally localises to the Left Optic Nerve. Additionally, there is hyperreflexia in the left biceps (3+) and focal weakness in the left first dorsal interosseous (4+/5). These are Upper Motor Neuron signs ipsilateral to the visual deficit, suggesting a second lesion affecting the corticospinal tract, likely in the high cervical spinal cord (as this explains ipsilateral arm findings), indicating a multifocal process.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Left Optic Nerve\", \"Left Cervical Spinal Cord\"]"
