    "response": "Urgent high-resolution imaging is needed to confirm the presence, exact location and nature of the pontine lesion and to distinguish infarct, demyelination, haemorrhage or tumour, which determines acute treatment. Vascular imaging assesses vertebrobasilar stenosis or dissection. CSF analysis and evoked potentials help diagnose multiple sclerosis or other inflammatory processes. Routine blood tests look for vascular risk factors, metabolic or infectious mimics and provide a baseline before antithrombotic or immunosuppressive therapy. Cardiac tests are required if an ischaemic stroke is confirmed to search for an embolic source.\n\ninvestigations = [\"MRI of brain with brainstem protocol and gadolinium\", \"MRI of cervical spine with gadolinium\", \"Magnetic resonance angiography of head and neck\", \"Non-contrast CT Brain\", \"Lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid analysis (cell count, protein, glucose, oligoclonal bands)\", \"Visual evoked potentials\", \"Full blood count\", \"Urea and electrolytes\", \"Liver function tests\", \"C-reactive protein\", \"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate\", \"Blood glucose\", \"Lipid profile\", \"HbA1c\", \"Coagulation screen\", \"Thyroid function tests\", \"Serum vitamin B12 level\", \"Serum folate level\", \"Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme level\", \"Antinuclear antibody\", \"Extractable nuclear antigen antibody panel\", \"Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies\", \"HIV antibody/antigen test\", \"Syphilis serology\", \"Aquaporin-4 antibody\", \"Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody\", \"Electrocardiogram\", \"Transthoracic echocardiogram\", \"24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring\"]"
