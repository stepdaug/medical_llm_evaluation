    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** Acute reperfusion therapy for ischaemic stroke (intravenous alteplase with or without mechanical thrombectomy)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Brainstem signs indicate a potentially devastating but treatable ischaemic stroke. Reperfusion must be delivered as soon as possible once imaging confirms acute infarction without haemorrhage and the patient falls within established time windows. Early treatment offers the best chance of reversing medullary deficits and preventing long-term disability.\n\n*   **Treatment:** Admission to a stroke unit or high-dependency unit\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Close monitoring of airway, breathing and circulation is essential in medullary lesions because of risk of respiratory and autonomic instability. Frequent neurological observations are needed to detect deterioration and manage complications promptly.\n\n*   **Treatment:** Nil by mouth with urgent swallow assessment by speech and language therapist\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Palatal weakness from nucleus ambiguus involvement implies high aspiration risk. Swallow function must be assessed before any oral intake to prevent aspiration pneumonia and ensure safe nutrition strategies.\n\n*   **Treatment:** Physiological optimisation (blood pressure, oxygenation, glucose and temperature control according to acute stroke guidelines)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Avoiding hypotension and hypoxia maintains perfusion of the ischaemic penumbra. Tight control of glucose and temperature reduces secondary brain injury and improves outcomes in acute stroke.\n\n*   **Treatment:** Mechanical deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with intermittent pneumatic compression\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Left hemiparesis and reduced mobility substantially increase venous thromboembolism risk. Mechanical prophylaxis is safe in both ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke while decisions about pharmacological prophylaxis are pending.\n\n*   **Treatment:** Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin followed by long-term secondary prevention regimen\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Aspirin should be started only after intracranial haemorrhage is excluded on imaging. If intravenous thrombolysis is administered, antiplatelets are delayed for at least 24 hours and until repeat imaging confirms no significant haemorrhagic transformation. The exact secondary prevention strategy may change if a cardioembolic or other non-atherothrombotic mechanism is identified.\n\n*   **Treatment:** Anticoagulation for proven cardioembolic source or vertebral artery dissection\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Initiated only if investigations reveal atrial fibrillation, intracardiac thrombus or vertebral artery dissection. Requires assessment of infarct size and haemorrhagic risk before starting therapeutic anticoagulation.\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone course\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Reserved for scenarios where MRI, CSF and serology support an acute demyelinating lesion (e.g. multiple sclerosis or NMOSD) rather than ischaemic stroke. Steroids are not part of standard management for uncomplicated ischaemic stroke and may be harmful if used inappropriately.\n\n*   **Treatment:** Multidisciplinary neurorehabilitation including physiotherapy and occupational therapy\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Commenced once the patient is medically stable after the hyperacute phase. Essential to address left-sided weakness, spasticity and cerebellar ataxia, optimise functional recovery and prevent complications such as contractures and deconditioning.\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"Acute reperfusion therapy for ischaemic stroke (intravenous alteplase with or without mechanical thrombectomy)\", \"timing\": \"Start Now\", \"reasons\": [\"Brainstem signs indicate a potentially devastating but treatable ischaemic stroke.\", \"Reperfusion must be delivered as soon as possible once imaging confirms acute infarction without haemorrhage and the patient falls within established time windows.\", \"Early treatment offers the best chance of reversing medullary deficits and preventing long-term disability.\"]}, {\"treatment\": \"Admission to a stroke unit or high-dependency unit\", \"timing\": \"Start Now\", \"reasons\": [\"Close monitoring of airway, breathing and circulation is essential in medullary lesions because of risk of respiratory and autonomic instability.\", \"Frequent neurological observations are needed to detect deterioration and manage complications promptly.\"]}, {\"treatment\": \"Nil by mouth with urgent swallow assessment by speech and language therapist\", \"timing\": \"Start Now\", \"reasons\": [\"Palatal weakness from nucleus ambiguus involvement implies high aspiration risk.\", \"Swallow function must be assessed before any oral intake to prevent aspiration pneumonia and ensure safe nutrition strategies.\"]}, {\"treatment\": \"Physiological optimisation (blood pressure, oxygenation, glucose and temperature control according to acute stroke guidelines)\", \"timing\": \"Start Now\", \"reasons\": [\"Avoiding hypotension and hypoxia maintains perfusion of the ischaemic penumbra.\", \"Tight control of glucose and temperature reduces secondary brain injury and improves outcomes in acute stroke.\"]}, {\"treatment\": \"Mechanical deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with intermittent pneumatic compression\", \"timing\": \"Start Now\", \"reasons\": [\"Left hemiparesis and reduced mobility substantially increase venous thromboembolism risk.\", \"Mechanical prophylaxis is safe in both ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke while decisions about pharmacological prophylaxis are pending.\"]}, {\"treatment\": \"Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin followed by long-term secondary prevention regimen\", \"timing\": \"Delay\", \"reasons\": [\"Aspirin should be started only after intracranial haemorrhage is excluded on imaging.\", \"If intravenous thrombolysis is administered, antiplatelets are delayed for at least 24 hours and until repeat imaging confirms no significant haemorrhagic transformation.\", \"The exact secondary prevention strategy may change if a cardioembolic or other non-atherothrombotic mechanism is identified.\"]}, {\"treatment\": \"Anticoagulation for proven cardioembolic source or vertebral artery dissection\", \"timing\": \"Delay\", \"reasons\": [\"Initiated only if investigations reveal atrial fibrillation, intracardiac thrombus or vertebral artery dissection.\", \"Requires assessment of infarct size and haemorrhagic risk before starting therapeutic anticoagulation.\"]}, {\"treatment\": \"High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone course\", \"timing\": \"Delay\", \"reasons\": [\"Reserved for scenarios where MRI, CSF and serology support an acute demyelinating lesion (e.g. multiple sclerosis or NMOSD) rather than ischaemic stroke.\", \"Steroids are not part of standard management for uncomplicated ischaemic stroke and may be harmful if used inappropriately.\"]}, {\"treatment\": \"Multidisciplinary neurorehabilitation including physiotherapy and occupational therapy\", \"timing\": \"Delay\", \"reasons\": [\"Commenced once the patient is medically stable after the hyperacute phase.\", \"Essential to address left-sided weakness, spasticity and cerebellar ataxia, optimise functional recovery and prevent complications such as contractures and deconditioning.\"]}]"
