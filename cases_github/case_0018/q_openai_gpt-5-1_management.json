    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3 days\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Typical inflammatory optic neuritis is the leading diagnosis and high-dose steroids shorten the duration of visual symptoms Early therapy may limit irreversible demyelinating damage to the optic nerve Can be initiated promptly after urgent MRI excludes compressive or infectious lesions\n\n*   **Treatment:** Oral prednisolone taper for 11\u201314 days following intravenous steroids\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Introduced after completing intravenous methylprednisolone to reduce risk of rebound inflammation Oral steroids alone without a preceding high-dose IV course are not recommended in demyelinating optic neuritis\n\n*   **Treatment:** Disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis if diagnostic criteria are met\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Requires MRI and CSF evidence of dissemination in time and space before initiation Choice of agent depends on individual risk profile and specialist neuroimmunology input Not required for acute visual recovery at the initial presentation\n\n*   **Treatment:** Therapeutic plasma exchange\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Reserved for severe optic neuritis or cases that fail to improve after high-dose corticosteroids Particularly important if neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder or MOG-antibody disease is confirmed or strongly suspected\n\n*   **Treatment:** Long-term immunosuppression for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder such as rituximab, inebilizumab, or eculizumab\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Instituted only if serology or clinical criteria confirm neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder Requires chronic monitoring for efficacy and adverse effects and is not started before a definite diagnosis\n\n*   **Treatment:** Simple analgesia such as paracetamol or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Periocular pain, especially with eye movements, is common in optic neuritis and can be distressing Safe symptomatic treatment that improves comfort while definitive investigations and therapies proceed\n\n*   **Treatment:** Proton pump inhibitor for gastroprotection while receiving high-dose corticosteroids\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Reduces risk of steroid-associated gastrointestinal irritation or bleeding Particularly important if non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are also used for analgesia\n\n*   **Treatment:** Referral for visual rehabilitation and occupational therapy if visual recovery is incomplete\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Need for rehabilitation can only be assessed after the course of visual recovery is known Provides strategies and low-vision aids to maximise independence if a permanent visual deficit remains\n\n*   **Treatment:** Antiplatelet therapy and aggressive vascular risk factor modification if ischaemic optic neuropathy is diagnosed\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Ischaemic optic neuropathy is less likely in this young patient but must be treated appropriately if confirmed Antiplatelet therapy carries bleeding risk and should be targeted to patients with proven vascular aetiology\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3 days\",
