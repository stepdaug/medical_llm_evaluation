    "response": "The clinical presentation of a young woman with neurological deficits disseminated in space and time is highly suggestive of a demyelinating disease like multiple sclerosis (MS). The investigation strategy is therefore aimed at three primary goals: 1) confirming the presence and distribution of central nervous system lesions using imaging, 2) finding evidence of CNS-specific inflammation through cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and 3) ruling out important MS mimics, particularly neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and neurosarcoidosis, the latter being especially relevant given the abnormal chest x-ray.\n\nThe highest priority investigation is an MRI of the entire neuraxis with contrast. This will visualize the lesions responsible for the clinical signs (in the right optic nerve, right cerebellum, spinal cord, and cerebral hemispheres) and determine if there is active inflammation (gadolinium enhancement), helping to satisfy diagnostic criteria for dissemination in space and time. Concurrently, specific blood tests for MS mimics (AQP4 and MOG antibodies) are crucial as their presence would fundamentally change the diagnosis and management. A lumbar puncture is essential to look for oligoclonal bands, a hallmark of MS. Given the chest x-ray finding of perihilar ground-glass changes, a high-resolution CT of the chest and serum ACE level are prioritized to investigate for sarcoidosis. The remaining tests screen for other inflammatory, infectious, and metabolic mimics.\n\ninvestigations = [\"MRI of brain and full spinal cord with gadolinium\", \"Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody serology\", \"Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein (MOG) antibody serology\", \"Lumbar puncture for CSF analysis (including oligoclonal bands, IgG index, cell count, and protein)\", \"High-resolution CT of the chest\", \"Serum Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) level\", \"Full Blood Count\", \"Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)\", \"Antinuclear Antibody (ANA) screen\", \"Syphilis serology\", \"HIV serology\", \"Vitamin B12 level\", \"Visual Evoked Potentials (VEPs)\", \"Urea and electrolytes\", \"Liver function tests\"]",
