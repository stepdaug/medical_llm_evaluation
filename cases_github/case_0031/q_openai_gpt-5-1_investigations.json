    "response": "Urgent neuroimaging is required to confirm a posterior circulation stroke, define the vascular status of the vertebrobasilar system and exclude haemorrhage or mass lesions. MRI will better characterise brainstem involvement and detect demyelinating plaques, while dedicated orbital imaging evaluates the optic nerve. Baseline blood tests are needed to assess stroke risk factors, guide acute therapies (e.g., thrombolysis, anticoagulation) and screen for inflammatory or systemic causes. Cardiac investigations look for embolic sources. CSF and specific antibodies help distinguish demyelinating and inflammatory conditions. Ophthalmic tests quantify the optic neuropathy and help differentiate demyelinating from ischaemic or compressive causes.\n\ninvestigations = [\"Non-contrast CT brain\", \"CT angiogram of head and neck (including vertebral and basilar arteries)\", \"MRI of brain and brainstem with diffusion-weighted imaging and gadolinium contrast\", \"MRI of orbits with fat suppression and gadolinium contrast\", \"MRI of cervical spine\", \"Full blood count\", \"Urea and electrolytes\", \"Liver function tests\", \"Coagulation screen\", \"Blood glucose\", \"Lipid profile\", \"HbA1c\", \"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate\", \"C-reactive protein\", \"Serum aquaporin-4 and MOG antibodies\", \"Thyroid function tests\", \"Vitamin B12 level\", \"Lumbar puncture for CSF cell count, protein, glucose and oligoclonal bands\", \"ECG\", \"Transthoracic echocardiogram\", \"Formal visual field testing\", \"Optical coherence tomography of retinal nerve fibre layer\", \"Visual evoked potentials\"]"
