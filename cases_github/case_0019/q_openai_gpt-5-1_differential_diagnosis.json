    "response": "The pattern is of a dorsal-column\u2013predominant thoracic myelopathy with accompanying right-sided corticospinal involvement in a young adult, without arm or cranial nerve signs. Metabolic myelopathies that preferentially involve dorsal and lateral columns (particularly vitamin B12 or copper deficiency, including nitrous oxide\u2013mediated functional B12 deficiency) are most likely. Vacuolar myelopathy from HIV, inflammatory demyelinating myelitis, hereditary spastic paraplegia, and non-traumatic compressive dorsal cord lesions are important alternatives, and systemic autoimmune diseases can cause a similar myelopathy.\n\ndifferential_diagnosis = [\"Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord due to vitamin B12 deficiency\", \"Nitrous oxide\\u2013induced functional vitamin B12 deficiency\", \"Copper deficiency myelopathy\", \"HIV-associated vacuolar myelopathy\", \"Inflammatory demyelinating myelitis (e.g., multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, MOG antibody-associated disease)\", \"Non-traumatic compressive dorsal spinal cord lesion (e.g., posterior cervical or thoracic meningioma, epidural abscess)\", \"Hereditary spastic paraplegia\", \"Spinal cord involvement secondary to systemic autoimmune disease (e.g., sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sj\\u00f6gren's syndrome)\"]"
