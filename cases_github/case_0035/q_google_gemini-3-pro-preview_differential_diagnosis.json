    "response": "The subacute progression over 12 days, worsening over the last 3, in a 41-year-old patient favors inflammatory or neoplastic etiologies over hyperacute vascular events. A brainstem glioma or lymphoma could explain the progressive mass effect. Demyelination (MS or NMOSD) is a strong differential given the age and location. Subacute ischaemia or an infectious rhombencephalitis (e.g., Listeria) remain possible.\n\ndifferential_diagnosis = [\"Brainstem Glioma\", \"Multiple Sclerosis (Demyelination)\", \"Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD)\", \"Subacute Pontine Ischaemic Stroke\", \"Rhombencephalitis (Listeria, HSV)\", \"Neurosarcoidosis\"]"
