    "response": "Urgent MRI is required to define the distribution, age and activity of CNS lesions and to exclude structural mass lesions. CSF analysis (including oligoclonal bands) and visual evoked potentials help confirm inflammatory demyelination and dissemination in time. Blood tests are needed both to rule out alternative metabolic, infectious and autoimmune causes and to provide a baseline prior to immunotherapy. Additional tests screen for mimics such as vasculitis, sarcoidosis and B12 deficiency, and for infections relevant to future disease-modifying therapies. Urine testing clarifies the suspected urinary tract infection before high-dose steroids.\n\ninvestigations = [\"MRI of brain, orbits and whole spine with gadolinium\", \"Lumbar puncture for CSF opening pressure, cell count, protein and glucose\", \"CSF oligoclonal bands and IgG index\", \"CSF microbiology and viral PCR panel as indicated\", \"Visual evoked potentials\", \"Optical coherence tomography of retinal nerve fibre layer\", \"Full blood count\", \"Urea and electrolytes\", \"Liver function tests\", \"C-reactive protein\", \"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate\", \"Serum vitamin B12\", \"Serum folate\", \"Serum copper\", \"Thyroid function tests\", \"Serum glucose\", \"HbA1c\", \"Serum aquaporin-4 IgG antibody\", \"Serum MOG-IgG antibody\", \"Antinuclear antibody\", \"Extractable nuclear antigen panel\", \"Double-stranded DNA antibody\", \"Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies\", \"Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme level\", \"Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation\", \"HIV serology\", \"Syphilis serology (TPHA and RPR or equivalent)\", \"Lyme disease serology (if epidemiologically indicated)\", \"Hepatitis B surface antigen\", \"Hepatitis C antibody\", \"Varicella zoster virus IgG\", \"Quantiferon-TB Gold test or tuberculin skin test\", \"Pregnancy test (beta-hCG) in women of childbearing potential\", \"ECG\", \"Chest CT scan with contrast (to assess for sarcoidosis or malignancy when suspected)\", \"Urine culture and sensitivity\"]"
