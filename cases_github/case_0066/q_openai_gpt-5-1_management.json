    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** Admit to monitored stroke/neurology unit with regular neurological observations\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Brainstem involvement increases risk of sudden deterioration in consciousness, respiration or autonomic function Allows frequent monitoring of pupillary size, eye movements and limb strength Facilitates rapid initiation of reperfusion or neurosurgical therapies once imaging is available\n\n*   **Treatment:** Optimise airway, breathing, circulation, oxygenation, blood pressure and blood glucose\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Preventing hypoxia, hypotension and hyperglycaemia reduces secondary brain injury in stroke or demyelination Brainstem lesions may compromise respiratory drive or airway protection Tight glucose control is important given the history of hyperglycaemia\n\n*   **Treatment:** Intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Should only be started if imaging confirms an acute ischaemic stroke without haemorrhage or large established infarct Must be given within the appropriate time window from symptom onset and in the absence of standard contraindications Important first to distinguish stroke from demyelinating plaque or tumour, where thrombolysis would be inappropriate\n\n*   **Treatment:** Mechanical thrombectomy for basilar or proximal posterior cerebral artery occlusion\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Indicated only if vascular imaging shows an accessible large-vessel occlusion in the posterior circulation Requires coordination with an interventional neuroradiology team Not appropriate if deficits are due to small-vessel lacunar infarct or demyelination\n\n*   **Treatment:** Early antiplatelet therapy with aspirin\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Start after intracranial haemorrhage and aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage have been excluded on imaging If intravenous thrombolysis is given, aspirin should be delayed for at least 24 hours to limit haemorrhagic transformation Avoids unnecessary bleeding risk if diagnosis proves to be demyelinating disease rather than stroke\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (for suspected optic neuritis or demyelinating relapse)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Should be initiated once MRI and CSF support an inflammatory demyelinating cause such as multiple sclerosis Steroids can mask infection and may be harmful if an untreated aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage or tumour is present Timing after exclusion of acute ischaemic stroke ensures therapies do not conflict with reperfusion strategies\n\n*   **Treatment:** Long-term disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Requires confirmation that McDonald criteria for MS are fulfilled with evidence of dissemination in space and time Choice of agent depends on prognosis, comorbidities and patient preference and needs detailed counselling Baseline laboratory and MRI monitoring must be arranged before initiation\n\n*   **Treatment:** Endovascular coiling or surgical clipping of a posterior communicating artery aneurysm\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Appropriate only if vascular imaging identifies a posterior communicating artery aneurysm explaining the third nerve palsy Requires multidisciplinary discussion with neurosurgery and interventional neuroradiology teams Timing and method depend on aneurysm size, morphology and clinical stability\n\n*   **Treatment:** Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with intermittent pneumatic compression and low-dose low-molecular-weight heparin\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Right hemiparesis and reduced mobility substantially increase deep vein thrombosis risk Mechanical prophylaxis can begin immediately on admission Pharmacological prophylaxis should follow imaging confirmation that there is no intracranial haemorrhage\n\n*   **Treatment:** Physiotherapy and occupational therapy for gait, balance and upper-limb function\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Early rehabilitation improves functional recovery in both stroke and demyelinating disease Addresses right-sided weakness, spasticity and cerebellar ataxia to reduce falls risk Enables assessment of home and workplace adaptations\n\n*   **Treatment:** Secondary stroke prevention with statin therapy\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Indicated if investigations confirm an ischaemic stroke or high atherosclerotic risk profile Should be tailored based on lipid profile, liver function and comorbidities May not be necessary if the primary diagnosis is a non-vascular demyelinating disorder without evidence of cerebrovascular disease\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"Admit to monitored stroke/neurology unit with regular neurological observations\", \"timing\":
