    "response": "The crossed brainstem findings (ipsilateral cranial nerve deficits, ipsilateral cerebellar signs and Horner syndrome, contralateral pyramidal signs and sensory change) in a 60-year-old strongly suggest a vascular aetiology affecting the left hemimedulla, most commonly vertebral artery territory ischaemia or dissection. However, the coexistent left optic neuropathy raises the possibility of a multifocal inflammatory/demyelinating process such as multiple sclerosis or neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. Neoplastic or infiltrative processes involving the brainstem and optic nerve are less likely but must be excluded, as must primary optic nerve pathologies such as ischaemic or compressive optic neuropathy.\n\ndifferential_diagnosis = [\"Left hemimedullary ischaemic stroke due to vertebral artery occlusion or dissection\", \"Multiple sclerosis with left optic neuritis and brainstem plaque\", \"Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder\", \"Brainstem neoplasm involving the left medulla (e.g., glioma or metastasis)\", \"Non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy of the left eye\", \"Compressive left optic neuropathy (e.g., optic nerve sheath meningioma)\", \"Primary CNS vasculitis or neurosarcoidosis involving brainstem and optic nerve\"]"
