    "response": "The patient presents with a classic 'crossed' brainstem syndrome. Left-sided cranial nerve signs (IX, X, XII palsies) and left Horner's syndrome (miosis, ptosis) clearly localise the lesion to the left medulla. The presence of right hemiparesis (corticospinal tract) and right-sided pain/temperature loss (spinothalamic tract) confirms a lesion affecting the left hemi-medulla. The unusual finding of left-sided proprioception loss suggests posterior extension involving the left dorsal column nuclei (gracile/cuneate) before their decussation. The isolated absence of the right ankle jerk, amidst widespread right-sided spasticity and hyperreflexia, is inconsistent with the upper motor neuron lesion and is best explained by the co-morbid degenerative disc disease affecting the S1 nerve root.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Left Hemimedulla\", \"Right S1 Nerve Root\"]"
