    "response": "Primary goal is to confirm CNS demyelination, assess dissemination in space/time, and exclude structural, vascular, infectious, autoimmune and metabolic mimics. MRI of brain/orbits and spine is key to localise and characterise lesions. CSF and evoked potentials support MS diagnosis. Blood tests screen for treatable mimics and guide future immunotherapy, while malignancy screening is reserved for suspected paraneoplastic cerebellitis.\n\ninvestigations = [\"MRI brain and orbits with gadolinium contrast\", \"MRI cervical spine with gadolinium contrast\", \"MRI thoracic spine with gadolinium contrast\", \"Lumbar puncture with CSF cell count and differential\", \"Lumbar puncture with CSF protein and glucose\", \"Lumbar puncture with CSF oligoclonal bands and IgG index\", \"Lumbar puncture with CSF culture and viral PCR as indicated\", \"Visual evoked potentials\", \"Optical coherence tomography of optic nerves and maculae\", \"Automated visual field testing (perimetry)\", \"Full blood count\", \"Urea and electrolytes\", \"Liver function tests\", \"C-reactive protein\", \"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate\", \"Blood glucose\", \"Thyroid function tests\", \"Vitamin B12 level\", \"Serum folate level\", \"Serum vitamin D level\", \"Serum aquaporin-4 IgG antibody\", \"Serum MOG IgG antibody\", \"Antinuclear antibody\", \"Extractable nuclear antigen panel\", \"Anti-double-stranded DNA antibody\", \"Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme level\", \"Syphilis serology (treponemal and non-treponemal tests)\", \"HIV antigen/antibody test\", \"Hepatitis B and C serology\", \"Coeliac serology (tissue transglutaminase IgA and total IgA)\", \"Paraneoplastic neuronal antibody panel\", \"CT scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis for malignancy screening (if paraneoplastic cerebellitis suspected)\", \"Electrocardiogram (pre-steroid and general medical assessment)\"]"
