    "response": "Urgent MRI is needed to confirm a structural or demyelinating lesion in the left parasagittal region and to characterise the optic nerve, guiding acute treatment and excluding compression before steroids. Ophthalmic tests further define the optic neuropathy. CSF and serological studies help distinguish multiple sclerosis from NMOSD, MOGAD, infection and other inflammatory or metabolic causes. Routine blood tests assess for metabolic contributors (B12 deficiency, diabetes control) and treatment safety. Neurophysiology helps identify any coexisting peripheral neuropathy.\n\ninvestigations = [\"MRI of brain and whole spine with gadolinium contrast including dedicated orbital sequences\", \"Ophthalmology slit-lamp and dilated fundus examination\", \"Optical coherence tomography of both optic nerves and maculae\", \"Automated visual field testing (perimetry)\", \"Visual evoked potentials\", \"Lumbar puncture for opening pressure measurement\", \"CSF cell count and differential\", \"CSF protein and glucose\", \"CSF oligoclonal bands and IgG index\", \"Serum aquaporin-4 IgG antibodies\", \"Serum MOG IgG antibodies\", \"Full blood count\", \"Urea and electrolytes\", \"Liver function tests\", \"C-reactive protein\", \"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate\", \"Blood glucose\", \"HbA1c\", \"Serum vitamin B12 level\", \"Serum folate level\", \"Serum methylmalonic acid level\", \"Thyroid-stimulating hormone\", \"Antinuclear antibody\", \"Extractable nuclear antigen panel\", \"ANCA\", \"Serum ACE level\", \"Serum copper and ceruloplasmin\", \"Screening for HIV, syphilis and Lyme disease as locally appropriate\", \"Nerve conduction studies and electromyography\", \"ECG\"]"
