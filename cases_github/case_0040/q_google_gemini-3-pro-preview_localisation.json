    "response": "The patient exhibits a right relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) and reduced visual acuity, localising to the right optic nerve. Additionally, there is right lower limb spastic weakness with hyperreflexia and an upgoing plantar response, accompanied by ipsilateral loss of vibration/proprioception and contralateral impairment of pinprick sensation with a thoracic sensory level. This describes a classic Brown-S\u00e9quard syndrome (hemicord lesion). The combination suggests multifocal inflammation affecting the optic nerve and spinal cord.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Right Optic Nerve\", \"Right Thoracic Spinal Cord\"]"
