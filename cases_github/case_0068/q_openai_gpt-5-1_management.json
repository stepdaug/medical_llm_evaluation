    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\u20135 days followed by a short oral taper\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Acute multifocal CNS inflammatory demyelinating attack with significant visual, brainstem and spinal cord deficits High-dose corticosteroids improve speed of recovery in optic neuritis and myelitis Can be commenced promptly once basic labs are drawn and acute haemorrhage or aneurysm is excluded on initial imaging\n\n*   **Treatment:** Proton pump inhibitor for gastric protection during high-dose steroid therapy\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Reduces risk of steroid-induced gastritis and peptic ulcer disease Low-risk prophylaxis appropriate at the time steroids are initiated\n\n*   **Treatment:** Comprehensive neurorehabilitation including physiotherapy, occupational therapy and gait/balance training\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Spastic paraparesis and ataxia already impair mobility and balance Early rehabilitation limits deconditioning, contractures and falls and improves long-term functional outcome\n\n*   **Treatment:** Symptomatic management of diplopia and ptosis (e.g., temporary eye patch, prism lenses, ophthalmology review)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Third nerve palsy can cause disabling diplopia affecting safety and quality of life Non-invasive measures provide immediate symptomatic relief while awaiting neurological recovery\n\n*   **Treatment:** Oral antispasticity agents such as baclofen or tizanidine\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Spasticity severity should be reassessed after the acute inflammatory phase and steroid treatment Medications require cautious titration to balance tone reduction against potential weakness and sedation\n\n*   **Treatment:** Initiation of disease-modifying therapy for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (e.g., ocrelizumab, natalizumab or other agent tailored to risk profile)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Requires confirmation of a demyelinating diagnosis with MRI and CSF studies Choice of agent depends on disease severity, comorbidities, pregnancy plans and patient preference Baseline infection screening and vaccination optimisation must be completed before starting potent immunotherapy\n\n*   **Treatment:** Endovascular coiling or surgical clipping of a posterior communicating artery aneurysm if confirmed\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Indicated only if vascular imaging demonstrates an aneurysm responsible for the third nerve palsy Timing and technique require multidisciplinary planning but would be undertaken urgently once diagnosed to prevent subarachnoid haemorrhage\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\\u20135 days followed by a short
