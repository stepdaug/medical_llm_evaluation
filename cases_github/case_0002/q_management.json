Initiate Treatment Decision

Yes.

Treatment should be initiated urgently based on the current clinical presentation, without waiting for the results of all investigations.
Therapeutic Plan

1. Acute Treatment of the Clinical Relapse

    Treatment: High-dose intravenous corticosteroids.

        Specific Regimen: Intravenous Methylprednisolone (IVMP) 1 gram daily for 3 to 5 days.

    Supportive Measures:

        Gastroprotection: Co-prescribe a proton pump inhibitor (e.g., omeprazole) to protect against gastric irritation.

        Monitoring: Monitor blood glucose levels, especially if the patient has risk factors for diabetes, as high-dose steroids can cause hyperglycemia.

    Contingency Plan:

        If there is a poor or no response to corticosteroids, especially given the severity of the vision loss and ataxia, Plasma Exchange (PLEX) would be the next therapeutic consideration.

2. Long-Term Management (To be initiated after diagnostic confirmation)

    Treatment: Counsel the patient about and plan for the initiation of a Disease-Modifying Therapy (DMT).

    Rationale: Once the diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis is confirmed by MRI and CSF analysis, the goal is to start long-term treatment to prevent future relapses and slow the progression of disability.

    Choice of Agent: Given the severity and multifocal nature of this initial presentation (which suggests a high future disease activity), a high-efficacy DMT (e.g., natalizumab, ocrelizumab, alemtuzumab, or ofatumumab) should be strongly considered from the outset, following a thorough discussion of risks and benefits with the patient.

Clinical Reasoning

The decision to treat immediately is based on the following:

    Severity of the Presentation: The patient is experiencing a severe, disabling neurological event. The left-sided vision loss ("Counting Fingers"), significant ataxia (high fall risk), and contralateral motor signs (spasticity, clonus) are causing major functional impairment. Untreated, this inflammation could lead to significant and permanent neurological disability.

    Nature of the Pathology: The clinical picture is overwhelmingly indicative of an acute, active inflammatory demyelinating event within the central nervous system. The primary goal of acute therapy is to suppress this inflammation, reduce edema, and restore the integrity of the blood-brain barrier.

    Standard of Care: High-dose intravenous corticosteroids are the evidence-based, first-line treatment for acute MS relapses. They have been shown to shorten the duration and reduce the severity of the attack, accelerating recovery. While they may not alter the ultimate long-term outcome from the relapse, they speed up the patient's functional improvement.

    Prognostic Implications: A severe, multifocal first attack is a poor prognostic indicator for the future course of MS. This underscores the need for not only aggressive acute treatment but also prompt initiation of a highly effective long-term DMT once the diagnosis is formally established. Delaying acute treatment would be inappropriate and potentially harmful.
