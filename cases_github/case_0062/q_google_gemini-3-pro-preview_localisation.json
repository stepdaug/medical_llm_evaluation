    "response": "The patient presents with a classic 'crossed' brainstem syndrome. There are ipsilateral lower motor neuron signs (Right CN VI palsy causing abduction deficit, Right CN VII palsy causing facial weakness affecting both upper and lower face) and contralateral upper motor neuron signs (Left hemiparesis with spasticity and hyperreflexia) and contralateral dorsal column sensory loss (Left-sided loss of vibration and proprioception). This clinically localises to the ventral aspect of the caudal pons on the right side, specifically affecting the abducens nerve fascicle, facial nerve fascicle, corticospinal tract, and medial lemniscus (Millard-Gubler syndrome pattern).\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Right Caudal Pons\"]"
