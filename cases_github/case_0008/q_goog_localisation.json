    "response": "My clinical reasoning is based on the constellation of distal, symmetric neurological deficits in the absence of central nervous system signs. The patient exhibits lower motor neuron signs, including weakness (distal legs and hands) and areflexia (knees and ankles), combined with a \"stocking\" distribution of sensory loss affecting all modalities (pinprick, vibration, and joint position sense). This pattern, where the longest nerves are affected most significantly, is the classic presentation of a length-dependent process affecting the peripheral nerves. The preservation of proximal function, cranial nerve function, and coordination further localises the problem to the peripheral nervous system.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Bilateral Length-dependent peripheral polyneuropathy\"]",
