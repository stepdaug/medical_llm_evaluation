    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** Urgent admission to a neurology or neurosurgery unit with close neurological observation and fall precautions\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Patient has objective long-tract signs and gait ataxia with high risk of falls and further deterioration Allows rapid access to MRI and specialist assessment\n\n*   **Treatment:** Urgent neurosurgical consultation for suspected cervicomedullary compression\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Combined pyramidal, sensory, and cerebellar signs localise to a potentially compressive lesion at the cervicomedullary junction Early neurosurgical input is crucial to plan timely decompression and prevent irreversible cord damage\n\n*   **Treatment:** Posterior fossa/foramen magnum decompression with or without tumour resection if MRI confirms a compressive structural lesion (e.g., foramen magnum meningioma or Chiari I malformation)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Definitive surgical planning requires MRI characterisation of the lesion and patient optimisation Avoids unnecessary surgery if imaging reveals a non-compressive or alternative pathology\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone followed by an oral taper if MRI and CSF support an inflammatory or demyelinating cervicomedullary lesion without major mass effect\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Steroids are first-line for acute inflammatory/demyelinating myelopathy but can worsen outcome if given before diagnosing a tumour or infection Treatment should be targeted once imaging and CSF exclude compressive and infectious causes\n\n*   **Treatment:** Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin if a posterior circulation infarct is confirmed and there are no contraindications\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Stroke-directed secondary prevention is indicated only once vascular imaging confirms an ischaemic aetiology Avoids unnecessary bleeding risk if lesion is instead tumoural or demyelinating\n\n*   **Treatment:** Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with intermittent pneumatic compression and/or low-molecular-weight heparin\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Patient has impaired mobility and spastic weakness increasing thromboembolic risk Standard preventive measure while awaiting definitive diagnosis and treatment\n\n*   **Treatment:** Physiotherapy and occupational therapy for gait training, balance, and upper-limb coordination\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Ataxic gait and limb incoordination predispose to falls and functional loss Early rehabilitation can improve safety and maintain muscle strength pending definitive treatment\n\n*   **Treatment:** Oral antispasticity agents such as baclofen or tizanidine for symptomatic control of lower limb spasticity\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Spasticity management should be individualised after the underlying cause is treated or stabilised Initiating too early may worsen weakness or interfere with neurological assessment\n\n*   **Treatment:** Speech and swallowing assessment with dietary modification if bulbar dysfunction emerges or after posterior fossa surgery\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Current cranial nerve examination shows no bulbar weakness, so immediate assessment is not essential Bulbar dysfunction may arise with progression or following surgical intervention and should then be addressed promptly\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"Urgent admission to a neurology or neurosurgery unit with close neurological
