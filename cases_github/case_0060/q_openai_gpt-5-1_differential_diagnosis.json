The peripheral findings are most consistent with diabetic neuropathy, and the unilateral severe visual loss may reflect either prior optic neuritis or advanced diabetic eye disease or ischaemic optic neuropathy.\n\ndifferential_diagnosis = [\"Multiple sclerosis (relapsing\\u2013remitting)\", \"Isolated left cerebellar infarct in the PICA or SCA territory (including vertebral artery dissection)\", \"Primary cerebellar tumour (e.g. low-grade astrocytoma) or cerebellar metastasis\", \"Autoimmune or post-infectious cerebellitis\", \"Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration\", \"Diabetic length-dependent sensorimotor polyneuropathy\", \"Advanced proliferative diabetic retinopathy of the left eye\", \"Non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy of the left eye\"]"
