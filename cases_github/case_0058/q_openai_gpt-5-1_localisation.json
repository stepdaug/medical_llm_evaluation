    "response": "Left-sided spastic weakness with hyperreflexia and extensor plantar response indicates a right-sided upper motor neuron lesion rostral to the pyramidal decussation. Concurrent right lower motor neuron facial weakness and primary position vertical (upbeat) nystagmus localise this to the right dorsal pons involving the facial nerve fascicle and adjacent corticospinal and cerebellar/vestibular pathways, giving a crossed brainstem syndrome. The unilateral reduction in visual acuity with a right relative afferent pupillary defect localises separately to the right optic nerve. Distal, symmetrical impairment of pinprick, vibration and joint position sense in a stocking\u2013glove pattern without a sensory level is most consistent with a superimposed length-dependent peripheral polyneuropathy.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"right dorsal pons\", \"right optic nerve\", \"bilateral length-dependent peripheral polyneuropathy\"]"
