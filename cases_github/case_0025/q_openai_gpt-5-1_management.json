    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** Admission to an acute stroke/neurology unit with close neurological observation\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Brainstem lesions can deteriorate rapidly and require frequent neurological checks Facilitates expedited imaging and multidisciplinary assessment\n\n*   **Treatment:** Mechanical venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with intermittent pneumatic compression\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Right hemiparesis and unsteady gait increase risk of deep vein thrombosis Mechanical prophylaxis is safe before brain imaging has excluded haemorrhage\n\n*   **Treatment:** Early physiotherapy and occupational therapy\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Promotes motor recovery and neuroplasticity in hemiparesis and ataxia Reduces risk of contractures, deconditioning and falls\n\n*   **Treatment:** Symptomatic management of diplopia with eye patching or prism lenses\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Left third nerve palsy is likely causing disabling diplopia Non-invasive symptomatic measures improve function while awaiting definitive therapy\n\n*   **Treatment:** Aspirin 300 mg loading then 75 mg daily for secondary stroke prevention\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Ischaemic midbrain infarct is the leading diagnosis but haemorrhage, cavernoma or tumour must be excluded first Should be commenced promptly once MRI/CT confirms a non-haemorrhagic vascular lesion\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-intensity statin therapy (e.g., atorvastatin 80 mg nightly)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Indicated if atherosclerotic or ischaemic stroke is confirmed Best started alongside antiplatelet therapy after imaging and baseline liver tests\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\u20135 days followed by oral taper\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Appropriate for an acute demyelinating or inflammatory brainstem lesion (e.g., MS, NMOSD, neurosarcoidosis) Should only be started once MRI and CSF support an inflammatory aetiology and infection or tumour are excluded\n\n*   **Treatment:** Neurosurgical or interventional neuroradiology consultation\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Required if imaging reveals a midbrain tumour, cavernous malformation, or aneurysm compressing the oculomotor nerve Not indicated if lesion is purely ischaemic or demyelinating\n\n*   **Treatment:** Blood pressure and vascular risk factor optimisation\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Aggressive risk factor modification is essential if a cerebrovascular cause is confirmed Blood pressure should be adjusted cautiously after the acute phase and in light of imaging findings\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"Admission to an acute
