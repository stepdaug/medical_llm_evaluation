    "response": "Right spastic hemiparesis with hyperreflexia and Babinski indicates an upper motor neuron lesion above the decussation; associated right limb ataxia and intention tremor suggest involvement of cerebellar outflow pathways; ipsilateral (left) partial third nerve palsy with ptosis, a dilated pupil and impaired eye movements plus primary position upbeat nystagmus points to a lesion affecting the left oculomotor fascicles and nearby vertical gaze/cerebellar pathways in the midbrain; absence of cortical features supports a focal left midbrain lesion producing a crossed brainstem syndrome (Weber/Benedikt pattern).\n\nlesion_locations = [\"left midbrain\"]"
