    "response": "Urgent imaging of the entire neuraxis is required to confirm the location and nature of the lesions and to check for dissemination in time (chronic plaques). CSF analysis and specific antibody testing (AQP4, MOG) are critical to differentiate between MS, NMOSD, and MOGAD, as this dictates long-term management. Baseline bloods exclude infectious or metabolic mimics.\n\ninvestigations = [\"MRI Brain and Whole Spine with gadolinium\", \"Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody test\", \"Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein (MOG) antibody test\", \"Lumbar Puncture (CSF microscopy, culture, glucose, protein, oligoclonal bands)\", \"Full blood count\", \"Urea and electrolytes\", \"Liver function tests\", \"C-reactive protein\", \"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate\", \"Thyroid function tests\", \"Vitamin B12\", \"Folate\", \"Autoimmune screen (ANA, ENA, dsDNA)\", \"Syphilis serology\", \"HIV serology\", \"Visual Evoked Potentials (VEP)\"]"
