This is evidenced by Left-sided Horner's syndrome (T1 sympathetic outflow), Left intrinsic hand weakness (C8/T1 LMN signs), Left leg spasticity/hyperreflexia (descending tract compression), and Right-sided spinothalamic sensory loss (crossing fibers). Additionally, the presence of Downbeat Nystagmus and Right limb ataxia indicates separate or extending pathology involving the posterior fossa structures.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Left Cervicothoracic Spinal Cord\", \"Right Cerebellum\", \"Unspecified Cervicomedullary Junction\"]"
