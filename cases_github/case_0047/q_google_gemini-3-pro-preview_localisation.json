    "response": "The patient presents with signs of multifocal CNS involvement (dissemination in space). There is clear evidence of a left optic neuropathy (reduced visual acuity and left Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect). Additionally, there is a cerebellar syndrome characterized by gaze-evoked nystagmus, ataxic gait, and specific right-sided limb incoordination (dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesia). While left upper limb hypotonia is noted, the coordination deficits firmly localise to the right cerebellar hemisphere.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Left Optic Nerve\", \"Right Cerebellar Hemisphere\"]"
