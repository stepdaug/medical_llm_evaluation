    "response": "My approach to selecting investigations is to confirm the presence of central nervous system inflammation, establish the spatial and temporal distribution of lesions to satisfy diagnostic criteria for conditions like multiple sclerosis, and simultaneously rule out key mimics suggested by the clinical presentation and comorbidities.\n\nThe highest priority is neuroimaging to visualise the lesions. An MRI of the brain, orbits, and full spinal cord with gadolinium contrast is essential to confirm optic neuritis, identify other demyelinating plaques characteristic of MS (fulfilling \"dissemination in space\"), and assess for active inflammation (gadolinium enhancement).\n\nSimultaneously, specific antibody testing is crucial to differentiate MS from its primary mimics, Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) and MOG Antibody Disease (MOGAD). Blood tests for AQP4 and MOG antibodies are therefore a high priority.\n\nGiven the abnormal chest X-ray and history of Raynaud's syndrome, investigating systemic inflammatory conditions is imperative. A CT scan of the chest is needed to better characterise the lung findings, while blood tests for Serum ACE (for sarcoidosis) and ANA (for connective tissue disease like lupus) are necessary.\n\nA lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid analysis is a core part of the workup to detect intrathecal inflammation (oligoclonal bands, elevated IgG index), which is highly supportive of an MS diagnosis.\n\nFinally, a panel of baseline and screening blood tests is required to rule out other mimics (like infections or vitamin deficiencies) and to ensure patient safety before initiating potential immunomodulatory treatments.\n\ninvestigations = [\"MRI of brain and orbits with gadolinium contrast\", \"MRI of cervical and thoracic spine with gadolinium contrast\", \"Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody test\", \"Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein (MOG) antibody test\", \"Lumbar puncture for CSF analysis (including oligoclonal bands and IgG index)\", \"CT scan of the chest\", \"Serum Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE)\", \"Antinuclear Antibody (ANA)\", \"Full blood count\", \"Urea and electrolytes\", \"Liver function tests\", \"Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)\", \"Vitamin B12\", \"Syphilis serology\", \"Lyme disease serology\", \"HIV serology\", \"Visual Evoked Potentials\"]",
