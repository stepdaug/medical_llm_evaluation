    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (e.g., 1 g daily for 3\u20135 days)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** If urgent MRI excludes structural compression and active infection, findings would be most consistent with inflammatory or demyelinating myelitis Early corticosteroid therapy hastens recovery from acute demyelinating spinal cord relapses and may limit permanent deficit Risk of a short high-dose steroid course is low relative to the potential functional benefit\n\n*   **Treatment:** Short oral prednisolone taper following intravenous methylprednisolone\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Given only after completing the intravenous steroid pulse Helps reduce rebound of symptoms and allows gradual withdrawal of high-dose corticosteroids\n\n*   **Treatment:** Urgent neurosurgical decompression of thoracic spinal cord if MRI shows compressive lesion\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Spinal cord compression is a neurosurgical emergency Early decompression maximises chance of neurological recovery and prevents progression to severe paraparesis or paraplegia Indicated immediately once a surgically remediable mass or significant canal compromise is confirmed\n\n*   **Treatment:** Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin and compression stockings\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Lower-limb weakness and reduced mobility increase risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism Prophylaxis is standard of care in patients with acute spinal cord dysfunction unless contraindicated\n\n*   **Treatment:** Early physiotherapy and gait and balance rehabilitation\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Prevents deconditioning and contractures in the weak right leg Improves balance and reduces fall risk in the context of sensory ataxia and spasticity\n\n*   **Treatment:** Neuropathic pain management with agents such as gabapentin, pregabalin, or amitriptyline as needed\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Sensory disturbance over the trunk may be dysaesthetic or painful Early control of neuropathic pain improves comfort, sleep, and participation in rehabilitation\n\n*   **Treatment:** Bladder and bowel assessment with institution of timed voiding, intermittent catheterisation, and bowel regimen if required\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Spinal cord lesions frequently cause urinary retention and constipation even before they are clinically obvious Early management prevents urinary tract infections, renal complications, and faecal impaction\n\n*   **Treatment:** Long-term immunomodulatory or disease-modifying therapy tailored to confirmed diagnosis (e.g., multiple sclerosis or neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Choice of agent depends on definitive diagnosis from imaging, CSF, and serology These therapies are initiated in a planned manner after the acute episode under specialist supervision\n\n*   **Treatment:** Parenteral vitamin B12 replacement if deficiency is identified\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Indicated only if investigations confirm vitamin B12 deficiency or related nutritional deficiency Correction of deficiency can halt or reverse subacute combined degeneration\u2013type cord pathology\n\n\ntreatments =
