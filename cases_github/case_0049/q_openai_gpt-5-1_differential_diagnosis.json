    "response": "Two spatially separated CNS lesions (optic nerve and thoracic cord) in a young adult strongly suggest an inflammatory demyelinating process; optic neuritis plus myelopathy makes relapsing\u2013remitting multiple sclerosis most likely, with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and MOG-antibody disease important alternatives. Structural cord compression and systemic inflammatory/infectious disorders are less likely but must be excluded because management differs substantially.\n\ndifferential_diagnosis = [\"Relapsing\\u2013remitting multiple sclerosis\", \"Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (AQP4-IgG associated)\", \"Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD)\", \"Inflammatory or granulomatous myelitis and optic neuropathy due to neurosarcoidosis\", \"Compressive thoracic myelopathy with unrelated optic neuropathy (e.g., tumour, disc, dural arteriovenous fistula)\", \"Subacute combined degeneration of the cord due to vitamin B12 deficiency\", \"Systemic autoimmune disease with CNS involvement (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis, Sj\\u00f6gren syndrome)\", \"Infectious myelitis or optic neuropathy (e.g., syphilis, HIV, Lyme disease)\"]"
