    "response": "This patient presents with a complex constellation of neurological signs and symptoms that cannot be explained by a single neuroanatomical lesion, indicating a multifocal process within the central nervous system. The clinical reasoning involves localizing distinct clusters of deficits:\n1.  **Left-sided upper motor neuron (UMN) signs:** The left leg weakness, spasticity, hyperreflexia (brisk knee jerk, clonus at the ankle), and an upgoing plantar response (Babinski sign) point to a lesion affecting the right corticospinal tract somewhere above the pyramidal decussation in the medulla. A common location for such a lesion would be the white matter of the right cerebral hemisphere, for instance, in the internal capsule.\n2.  **Right-sided cerebellar signs:** The dysmetria on finger-nose and heel-shin testing, dysdiadochokinesia, and gaze-evoked nystagmus are all indicative of a lesion in the right cerebellum or its associated pathways.\n3.  **Right optic neuropathy:** The reduced visual acuity (6/12) and the presence of a right relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) definitively localize a lesion to the right optic nerve, anterior to the optic chiasm.\n4.  **Right-sided sensory deficits:** The loss of joint position sense and vibration on the right side points to a lesion in the right dorsal columns of the spinal cord.\n5.  **Focal right-sided weakness:** The profound and isolated weakness of right great toe extension (0/5) in the context of other UMN signs is best explained by a small, focal lesion in the contralateral (left) motor cortex, specifically the \"foot knob\" area of the precentral gyrus.\nThis dissemination of lesions in space (right optic nerve, right cerebellum, right cerebral hemisphere/internal capsule, spinal cord, and left cerebral hemisphere) is characteristic of a demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Right Optic Nerve\", \"Right Cerebellar Hemisphere\", \"Right Internal Capsule\", \"Right Dorsal Column of the Spinal Cord\", \"Left Precentral Gyrus\"]",
