    "response": "Left ptosis, dilated non-reactive pupil and ophthalmoplegia indicate a left oculomotor fascicular lesion; right spastic hemiparesis with hyperreflexia, right hemisensory loss and right limb ataxia point to involvement of left corticospinal, medial lemniscal/spinothalamic pathways and superior cerebellar peduncle/red nucleus within the midbrain; downbeat nystagmus supports a central brainstem/cerebellar lesion. The marked left visual acuity loss with left RAPD requires an additional pre\u2011chiasmal left optic nerve lesion.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"left midbrain\", \"left optic nerve\"]"
