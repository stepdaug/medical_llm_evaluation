    "response": "The patient presents with a 'crossed' brainstem syndrome. Right-sided cranial nerve signs (Horner's syndrome, palatal deviation implying right vagal nerve palsy, tongue deviation implying right hypoglossal nerve palsy, and nystagmus) localize to the right medulla. Right-sided cerebellar signs (intention tremor, dysmetria) implicate the right inferior cerebellar peduncle. Contralateral (left-sided) hemiparesis and contralateral loss of all sensory modalities (pain, temperature, vibration, proprioception) indicate involvement of the right medullary pyramid, spinothalamic tract, and medial lemniscus. This combination of lateral medullary (Wallenberg) and medial medullary (Dejerine) features confirms a right hemimedullary lesion.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Right Medulla Oblongata\"]"
