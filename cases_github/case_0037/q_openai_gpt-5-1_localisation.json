    "response": "Subacute onset of right spastic hemiparesis with brisk reflexes and extensor plantar, right hemisensory loss and right limb ataxia/intention tremor, together with ipsilateral (left) complete ptosis, dilated pupil with ophthalmoplegia and primary-position downbeat nystagmus, is best explained by a single lesion in the left midbrain tegmentum and cerebral peduncle affecting the oculomotor fascicles, corticospinal tract, sensory pathways and superior cerebellar peduncle (Benedikt-/Claude-type midbrain syndrome). The separate finding of reduced right visual acuity with a right relative afferent pupillary defect localises to the right optic nerve.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"left midbrain\", \"right optic nerve\"]"
