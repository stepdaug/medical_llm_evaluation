    "response": "Right-sided spastic hemiparesis with brisk reflexes and Babinski, together with ipsilateral (left) lower cranial nerve IX/X and XII palsies, left Horner's syndrome, gaze-evoked nystagmus, ipsilateral limb ataxia and gait unsteadiness, form a crossed brainstem syndrome localising to the left medulla involving corticospinal tracts, nucleus ambiguus, hypoglossal nucleus/nerve, vestibular nuclei, inferior cerebellar connections and descending sympathetics. The unilateral reduction in visual acuity with a left relative afferent pupillary defect localises separately to the left optic nerve. The isolated absent right ankle jerk is likely incidental peripheral root disease and is not required to explain the main syndrome.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"left optic nerve\", \"left medulla oblongata\"]"
