    "response": "The patient presents with a constellation of findings pointing to two distinct anatomical lesions (dissemination in space). First, the reduced visual acuity (6/24) and Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect (RAPD) in the right eye indicate a right optic neuropathy. Second, the motor and sensory findings characterize a classic Brown-S\u00e9quard syndrome (hemicord lesion): right-sided upper motor neuron weakness (spasticity, hyperreflexia, upgoing plantar), right-sided loss of dorsal column modalities (vibration, proprioception), and contralateral (left-sided) loss of spinothalamic modalities (pinprick). The 'numb band across the chest' on the right localises the spinal level to the thoracic region.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Right Optic Nerve\", \"Right Thoracic Spinal Cord\"]"
