    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** Intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\u20135 days\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Standard first-line therapy for acute optic neuritis and myelitis due to suspected inflammatory demyelination Can accelerate neurological and visual recovery and may limit permanent cord and optic nerve damage Benefits of early treatment outweigh risks in a young otherwise healthy patient once sepsis is excluded\n\n*   **Treatment:** Oral prednisolone taper for 1\u20132 weeks following intravenous steroids\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Used after completion of IV methylprednisolone to reduce risk of rebound relapse and allow gradual steroid withdrawal Should be tailored to response and contraindications after initial IV course\n\n*   **Treatment:** Initiation of disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis (high-efficacy agent tailored to risk profile if MS confirmed)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Requires confirmation of MS by McDonald criteria and exclusion of NMOSD/MOGAD and other mimics Choice of agent depends on MRI lesion burden, relapse severity, comorbidities and serological status (e.g., JCV, hepatitis) Best initiated in a planned manner in a specialist MS clinic once diagnostic workup is complete\n\n*   **Treatment:** Long-term immunosuppression with agents such as rituximab, mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine if NMOSD or MOGAD confirmed\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Type and intensity of maintenance therapy depend on antibody status and diagnostic confirmation These agents carry significant infectious and haematological risks and should not be started before definitive diagnosis Regimens should be individualised and commenced under specialist neuroimmunology supervision\n\n*   **Treatment:** Plasma exchange\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Reserved for severe optic neuritis or myelitis with poor response to initial high-dose steroids Invasive therapy requiring vascular access and haemodynamic monitoring, so decision should follow assessment of steroid response over several days\n\n*   **Treatment:** Physiotherapy, gait and balance rehabilitation\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Addresses left leg weakness, spasticity and unsteady gait to reduce fall risk and promote functional recovery Early mobilisation helps prevent deconditioning, contractures and venous thromboembolism\n\n*   **Treatment:** Spasticity management (e.g., oral baclofen or tizanidine, stretching programme)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Left lower limb spasticity with clonus is already functionally significant and may worsen mobility and cause pain Early pharmacological and physical measures can improve comfort and gait while limiting long-term contractures\n\n*   **Treatment:** Proton pump inhibitor for gastric protection during high-dose steroid therapy\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** High-dose corticosteroids increase risk of gastrointestinal irritation and ulceration Simple prophylaxis with PPI reduces steroid-related gastric complications, especially in stressed or hospitalised patients\n\n*   **Treatment:** Thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin and mechanical compression while inpatient and mobility is reduced\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Spastic paraparesis and reduced mobility increase venous thromboembolism risk Hospitalisation and high-dose steroids further augment this risk, so standard prophylaxis is indicated unless contraindicated\n\n*   **Treatment:** Vitamin D supplementation and lifestyle modification (e.g., smoking cessation, exercise programme)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Adjunctive strategies that may favourably influence long-term MS disease activity if MS is confirmed Can be initiated after baseline laboratory assessment including calcium and vitamin D levels\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\":
