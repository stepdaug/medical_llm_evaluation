    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** Admission to hyperacute stroke unit with airway, breathing and circulation optimisation and frequent neurological observations\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Brainstem strokes carry high risk of rapid deterioration and respiratory compromise Close monitoring allows prompt treatment of complications such as raised intracranial pressure, aspiration, and arrhythmias\n\n*   **Treatment:** Intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase for ischaemic stroke\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Strong suspicion of acute ischaemic midbrain stroke within potential treatment window Should be administered as soon as imaging confirms ischaemia and excludes haemorrhage and there are no contraindications Timely reperfusion is critical to limit irreversible brainstem damage and disability\n\n*   **Treatment:** Mechanical thrombectomy for basilar or proximal posterior cerebral artery occlusion\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Indicated if CT/MR angiography demonstrates a treatable large-vessel occlusion in the posterior circulation Endovascular therapy improves outcome in appropriately selected patients even beyond the standard thrombolysis window\n\n*   **Treatment:** Aspirin 300 mg orally or via nasogastric tube followed by 75 mg daily\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Antiplatelet therapy is indicated for secondary prevention after ischaemic stroke Must be delayed until brain imaging has excluded intracranial haemorrhage If thrombolysis is given, aspirin should start 24 hours later after repeat imaging to reduce risk of haemorrhagic transformation\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-intensity statin therapy (e.g., atorvastatin 80 mg nightly)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Reduces risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke and other vascular events Typically initiated within the first 24 hours once swallowing is assessed and liver function is known\n\n*   **Treatment:** Early multidisciplinary neurorehabilitation (physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and speech and language therapy)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Should begin as soon as the patient is haemodynamically stable and acute interventions are completed Essential to maximise recovery from right-sided weakness and ataxia and to prevent complications of immobility\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Reserved for cases where imaging and CSF studies demonstrate a demyelinating brainstem lesion rather than vascular stroke Steroids before diagnostic clarification could worsen outcomes in haemorrhagic or ischaemic stroke\n\n*   **Treatment:** Analgesia and antiemetics for headache and photophobia (e.g., paracetamol and ondansetron)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Provides symptomatic relief of severe headache and associated nausea Agents chosen to avoid excessive sedation or blood pressure lowering that could compromise cerebral perfusion\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"Admission to hyperacute stroke unit with airway, breathing and circulation optimisation and frequent neurological observations\", \"timing\": \"Start
