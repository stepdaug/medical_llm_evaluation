Concomitant right\u2011leg\u2011predominant UMN weakness with hyperreflexia/clonus and distal sensory loss is best explained by a single lesion in the contralateral medial frontoparietal (leg) cortex. Left RAPD and reduced acuity indicate a left optic nerve lesion. Multifocal CNS involvement suggests dissemination in space.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"right cerebellar hemisphere\", \"left paracentral lobule\", \"left optic nerve\"]"
