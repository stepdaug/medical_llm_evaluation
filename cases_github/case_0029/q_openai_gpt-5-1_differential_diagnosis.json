    "response": "The coherent crossed long-tract and cranial nerve findings point to a focal structural lesion in the right medulla rather than a diffuse metabolic process. The pattern is classical for a hemimedullary stroke, although the patient's young age necessitates strong consideration of demyelination and less common structural causes such as intrinsic brainstem tumours or vascular malformations. Autoimmune demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis or neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder can also produce solitary medullary plaques.\n\ndifferential_diagnosis = [\"Right hemimedullary ischaemic stroke (vertebral or anterior spinal artery infarction)\", \"Demyelinating brainstem lesion due to multiple sclerosis\", \"Right medullary brainstem glioma\", \"Right medullary cavernous malformation with recent haemorrhage\", \"Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder involving the medulla\"]"
