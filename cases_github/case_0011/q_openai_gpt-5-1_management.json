    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\u20135 days\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Subacute severe brainstem and optic nerve deficits are highly suggestive of an inflammatory demyelinating relapse Early corticosteroids accelerate recovery and reduce duration of neurological disability To be commenced immediately after MRI excludes compressive mass or intracranial haemorrhage\n\n*   **Treatment:** Oral prednisolone taper for 1\u20132 weeks after intravenous steroids\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Introduced after completing IV methylprednisolone to prevent rebound symptoms Dosing and duration depend on response, comorbidities and glucose control\n\n*   **Treatment:** Initiation of disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis (e.g., interferon beta, glatiramer acetate or higher-efficacy agent per MS specialist advice)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Requires confirmation of demyelinating disease by MRI and CSF studies and exclusion of mimics Choice of agent must be individualised based on relapse severity, lesion burden and patient factors Usually started after the acute relapse has stabilised\n\n*   **Treatment:** Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 300 mg daily and subsequent maintenance dosing if ischaemic stroke is confirmed and no contraindications\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Stroke remains a differential but cannot be assumed without neuroimaging and CSF results Starting antiplatelets before excluding haemorrhage or inflammatory demyelination may be harmful\n\n*   **Treatment:** Neurosurgical or interventional neuroradiology referral for decompression or aneurysm treatment if a compressive or vascular lesion is identified\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Indicated only if imaging demonstrates a surgically or endovascularly treatable cause (e.g., tumour, cavernoma, aneurysm) Definitive structural treatment must follow accurate anatomical and aetiological diagnosis\n\n*   **Treatment:** Physiotherapy and occupational therapy for gait ataxia and right-sided weakness\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Early multidisciplinary rehabilitation improves functional outcome and independence Patient already exhibits unsteady gait and right hemiparesis with high falls risk\n\n*   **Treatment:** Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin and graduated compression stockings\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Hemiparesis and reduced mobility significantly increase venous thromboembolism risk Prophylaxis is standard in immobilised neurological inpatients absent contraindications\n\n*   **Treatment:** Proton pump inhibitor and blood glucose monitoring during high-dose steroid therapy\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** High-dose corticosteroids increase risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and hyperglycaemia Preventive measures should be instituted concurrently with steroid therapy\n\n*   **Treatment:** Visual rehabilitation and symptomatic management of diplopia or visual field impairment (e.g., eye patch, prisms, orthoptic referral)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Best organised after the acute phase when neurological deficits have stabilised Aims to optimise functional vision and quality of life during recovery\n\n\ntreatments =
