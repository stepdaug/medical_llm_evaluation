    "response": "Urgent MRI of the brain and whole spine with contrast is needed to confirm the cervical cord lesion, define its extent, and distinguish intrinsic inflammatory disease from compressive mass lesions. Blood tests assess for infection, inflammatory and autoimmune causes, nutritional deficiencies, and treatment contraindications. CSF analysis further differentiates demyelinating, infectious, neoplastic, and other inflammatory myelopathies. Additional imaging screens for systemic malignancy or granulomatous disease if a compressive or infiltrative process is detected.\n\ninvestigations = [\"MRI of brain and whole spine with gadolinium contrast\", \"Full blood count\", \"C-reactive protein\", \"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate\", \"Urea and electrolytes\", \"Liver function tests\", \"Coagulation screen\", \"Blood glucose\", \"Serum vitamin B12\", \"Serum folate\", \"Serum copper\", \"Thyroid function tests\", \"Serum antinuclear antibody\", \"Extractable nuclear antigen panel\", \"Anti-double-stranded DNA antibody\", \"Antiphospholipid antibody panel\", \"Aquaporin-4 (NMO-IgG) antibody\", \"Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody\", \"Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme level\", \"HIV serology\", \"Syphilis serology (e.g., VDRL/TPHA)\", \"Lyme disease serology\", \"Blood cultures\", \"Lumbar puncture with CSF opening pressure measurement\", \"CSF cell count and differential\", \"CSF protein\", \"CSF glucose\", \"CSF oligoclonal bands and IgG index\", \"CSF bacterial culture\", \"CSF viral PCR panel\", \"CSF cytology\", \"CT scan of chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast\", \"CT of cervical spine with contrast (if MRI is contraindicated or to clarify bony anatomy)\"]"
