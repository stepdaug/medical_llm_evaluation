    "response": "A unilateral optic neuropathy plus a contralateral cerebellar lesion in a man in his 50s suggests a multifocal CNS process. Demyelinating disease (particularly multiple sclerosis) is the leading unifying cause, but the markedly raised CRP raises concern for systemic vasculitis, especially giant cell arteritis with ischaemic optic neuropathy and posterior circulation stroke. Other inflammatory, autoimmune, infectious, and neoplastic conditions that can affect optic nerve and cerebellum must also be considered.\n\ndifferential_diagnosis = [\"Multiple sclerosis (relapsing-remitting) presenting with right optic neuritis and left cerebellar plaque\", \"Giant cell arteritis with arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy and vertebrobasilar ischaemic stroke\", \"Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder\", \"Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease\", \"Neurosarcoidosis involving optic nerve and cerebellum\", \"Primary angiitis of the central nervous system\", \"Paraneoplastic autoimmune cerebellar degeneration with optic neuropathy\", \"Infectious CNS involvement (neurosyphilis, Lyme neuroborreliosis, HIV-associated CNS disease)\", \"Metastatic disease involving the right optic nerve and left cerebellum\"]"
