    "response": "This patient's clinical presentation points to multiple distinct lesions within the central nervous system. The combination of reduced visual acuity (6/18) and a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) in the left eye specifically localises a lesion to the left afferent visual pathway, anterior to the optic chiasm. This is characteristic of a left optic neuropathy.\n\nSeparately, the patient exhibits prominent cerebellar signs. The ataxic gait, unstable tandem, and rebound nystagmus indicate cerebellar dysfunction. Crucially, the appendicular ataxia (dysmetria on finger-nose and heel-shin testing, and dysdiadochokinesia) is confined to the right side. Since cerebellar control of the limbs is ipsilateral, these findings point to a lesion within the right cerebellar hemisphere or its connecting pathways. The absence of sensory deficits and a negative Romberg test confirm the ataxia is cerebellar, not sensory, in origin. The combination of anatomically separate lesions is characteristic of a demyelinating disease like multiple sclerosis.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Left Optic Nerve\", \"Right Cerebellar Hemisphere\"]",
