    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-Dose Intravenous Methylprednisolone\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** The patient is experiencing an acute, functionally disabling neurological event consistent with a demyelinating attack. High-dose corticosteroids are the standard of care to reduce the inflammation associated with the active lesions in the optic nerve and spinal cord, thereby shortening the duration of the relapse and accelerating recovery.\n\n*   **Treatment:** Disease-Modifying Therapy (DMT)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** While the presentation is highly suggestive of Multiple Sclerosis and warrants long-term treatment, the immediate priority is managing the acute relapse. The initiation of a specific DMT should be delayed until the acute phase is managed and crucial diagnostic results (e.g., MRI, serology for MS mimics like NMOSD and MOGAD) are available to confirm the diagnosis and guide the most appropriate therapy choice. This also allows for a thorough discussion with the patient about the risks and benefits of different DMT options.\n\n*   **Treatment:** Multidisciplinary Rehabilitation (including Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** The patient has significant weakness and sensory ataxia, resulting in an unsteady gait and positive Romberg sign. Early initiation of physiotherapy is crucial to improve strength, balance, and gait safety. Occupational therapy can help develop strategies to manage the weakness in her right arm and maintain independence in daily activities during and after the acute phase.\n\n*   **Treatment:** Symptomatic Management for Spasticity (e.g., Baclofen or Gabapentin)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** The patient has spasticity in the right lower limb. However, the severity of this symptom may decrease significantly following treatment for the acute relapse. It is prudent to delay the initiation of anti-spasticity medication until the patient's condition has stabilized, to avoid unnecessary medication and to accurately assess the need for long-term symptomatic therapy.\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"High-Dose Intravenous Methylprednisolone\", \"timing\": \"Start Now\", \"reasons\": [\"To reduce inflammation of active demyelinating lesions\", \"To shorten the duration and severity of the acute relapse\", \"To accelerate functional recovery\"]}, {\"treatment\": \"Disease-Modifying Therapy (DMT)\", \"timing\": \"Delay\", \"reasons\": [\"Awaiting definitive diagnostic confirmation and exclusion of mimics (NMOSD, MOGAD)\", \"To allow for a considered discussion with the patient about long-term treatment options after the acute phase\"]}, {\"treatment\": \"Multidisciplinary Rehabilitation (Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy)\", \"timing\": \"Start Now\", \"reasons\": [\"To address current functional deficits including weakness and sensory ataxia\", \"To improve gait stability and reduce fall risk\", \"To maximize long-term functional recovery\"]}, {\"treatment\": \"Symptomatic Management for Spasticity\", \"timing\": \"Delay\", \"reasons\": [\"The degree of residual spasticity after acute relapse treatment is unknown\", \"To avoid unnecessary medication by re-assessing the need once the clinical picture has stabilized\"]}]",
