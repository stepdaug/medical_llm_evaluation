    "response": "The clinical presentation demonstrates dissemination in space. The patient has a Left Optic Neuropathy (evidenced by reduced acuity and Left RAPD). Additionally, there is a classic 'crossed' brainstem syndrome: Left-sided cranial nerve palsies (IX, X, XII, and sympathetic chain causing Horner's) and Left cerebellar signs, combined with Contralateral (Right) hemiparesis and hemisensory loss. This constellation confirms a lesion in the Left Medulla Oblongata (Hemimedullary syndrome). The 'dry, irritating cough' specifically localises to the Area Postrema within the dorsal medulla. Finally, the isolated absent Right Ankle jerk, in the context of spasticity and back pain, suggests a co-existing compressive root lesion.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Left Optic Nerve\", \"Left Medulla Oblongata\", \"Right S1 Spinal Root\"]"
