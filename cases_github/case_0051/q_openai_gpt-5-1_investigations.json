    "response": "Urgent neuroimaging is required to confirm a pontine lesion and distinguish ischaemic from haemorrhagic or structural causes, guiding time-critical reperfusion therapy. Vascular imaging and cardiac work-up help define stroke mechanism. Basic blood tests assess for metabolic contributors and treatment contraindications. Additional MRI sequences, CSF analysis, and autoimmune testing are needed if imaging suggests demyelinating, inflammatory, or neoplastic pathology.\n\ninvestigations = [\"Non-contrast CT brain\", \"CT angiogram of head and neck\", \"MRI of brain and cervical spine with diffusion-weighted imaging and gadolinium contrast\", \"MR angiogram of intracranial vessels\", \"ECG\", \"Continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring\", \"Transthoracic echocardiogram\", \"Full blood count\", \"Urea and electrolytes\", \"Liver function tests\", \"Coagulation screen\", \"Blood glucose\", \"Lipid profile\", \"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate\", \"C-reactive protein\", \"Autoimmune screen including antinuclear antibody and extractable nuclear antigens\", \"Serum aquaporin-4 antibody\", \"Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody\", \"Lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid analysis including oligoclonal bands, cell count, protein and glucose\"]"
