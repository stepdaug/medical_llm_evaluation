    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** High dose corticosteroid therapy for presumed giant cell arteritis (for example intravenous methylprednisolone 500\u20131000 mg daily for 3 days followed by high dose oral prednisolone)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Age over 50 with acute unilateral visual loss and relative afferent pupillary defect strongly suggests arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy Raised inflammatory markers markedly increase the pre test probability of giant cell arteritis Delay in steroid treatment significantly increases the risk of permanent bilateral blindness Temporal artery biopsy and imaging remain interpretable if performed within 1\u20132 weeks after starting steroids\n\n*   **Treatment:** Proton pump inhibitor for gastrointestinal protection during high dose steroid therapy\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** High dose systemic steroids increase the risk of peptic ulcer disease and upper gastrointestinal bleeding Concurrent gastroprotection reduces avoidable steroid related gastrointestinal complications Patient is likely to require a prolonged steroid taper\n\n*   **Treatment:** Low dose aspirin 75\u2013100 mg daily\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Often recommended in giant cell arteritis to reduce further cranial ischaemic events when not contraindicated May provide additional vascular protection if the final diagnosis is an ischaemic optic neuropathy or retinal vascular occlusion Bleeding risk can be mitigated with gastroprotection and assessment of contraindications\n\n*   **Treatment:** Calcium and vitamin D supplementation\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Indicated to prevent steroid induced osteoporosis when prolonged corticosteroid therapy is confirmed Can be initiated after baseline calcium and vitamin D levels and bone health assessment\n\n*   **Treatment:** Bisphosphonate therapy such as oral alendronate\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Recommended for patients commencing long term high dose steroids who are at increased fracture risk Should follow fracture risk stratification and, ideally, dental review to minimise risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw\n\n*   **Treatment:** Disease modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis if demyelinating optic neuritis is confirmed\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Requires confirmation of multiple sclerosis with MRI and clinical criteria before initiation Choice of agent must be individualised and started in a specialist neuroimmunology service\n\n*   **Treatment:** Aggressive vascular risk factor modification including antihypertensive therapy, statin therapy, and smoking cessation support\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Important for long term secondary prevention if an ischaemic optic neuropathy or retinal vascular event is confirmed Implementation should follow comprehensive cardiovascular risk assessment and coordination with primary care\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"High dose corticosteroid therapy for presumed giant cell arteritis
