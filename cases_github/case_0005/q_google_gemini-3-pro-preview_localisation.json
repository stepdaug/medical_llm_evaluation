    "response": "The patient presents with signs of multifocal involvement of the central nervous system (dissemination in space). The reduced visual acuity (6/18) and Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect (RAPD) on the left indicate an ipsilateral pre-chiasmal lesion, specifically optic neuropathy. The right-sided appendicular dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesia, unstable gait, and rebound nystagmus indicate a lesion of the ipsilateral cerebellar hemisphere. The subtle weakness in the left great toe suggests a possible third lesion in the corticospinal tract (e.g., spinal cord), consistent with a multifocal demyelinating process, but the primary localisations explaining the major deficits are the optic nerve and cerebellum.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Left Optic Nerve\", \"Right Cerebellar Hemisphere\"]"
