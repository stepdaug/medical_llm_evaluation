    "response": "Urgent neuroimaging is required to confirm a right medullary lesion, distinguish ischaemic stroke from demyelination or tumour, and determine eligibility for time-critical reperfusion therapy. Vascular imaging must assess vertebral and basilar arteries for occlusion or dissection. Baseline laboratory tests exclude metabolic mimics and provide safety data for thrombolysis. Autoimmune and thrombophilia studies are important in a young patient with suspected stroke, while specific antibody testing and CSF analysis help diagnose demyelinating or inflammatory aetiologies. Cardiac evaluation searches for a potential embolic source.\n\ninvestigations = [\"Non-contrast CT brain\", \"CT angiogram of head and neck\", \"MRI of brain and cervical spinal cord with and without gadolinium contrast, including diffusion-weighted imaging\", \"Full blood count\", \"Urea and electrolytes\", \"Liver function tests\", \"Coagulation screen (PT, APTT, INR)\", \"C-reactive protein\", \"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate\", \"Blood glucose\", \"Serum lipid profile\", \"Antinuclear antibody\", \"Antiphospholipid antibodies\", \"Factor V Leiden mutation assay\", \"Prothrombin G20210A mutation assay\", \"Protein C level\", \"Protein S level\", \"Antithrombin III level\", \"Serum homocysteine level\", \"Serum aquaporin-4 IgG antibody\", \"Serum myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody\", \"HIV antibody/antigen test\", \"Syphilis serology (VDRL or RPR with confirmatory treponemal test)\", \"Lumbar puncture with CSF cell count, protein, glucose, oligoclonal bands and viral PCR\", \"12-lead ECG\", \"Transthoracic echocardiogram\", \"24-hour Holter cardiac monitor\"]"
