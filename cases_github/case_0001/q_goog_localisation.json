    "response": "My clinical reasoning is based on identifying distinct clusters of neurological signs and symptoms that localize to separate parts of the central nervous system. This patient presents with evidence of at least two separate lesions.\n\nFirst, the findings in the left eye\u2014specifically the reduced visual acuity (6/24) and the presence of a left relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD)\u2014unequivocally point to a lesion in the afferent visual pathway anterior to the optic chiasm. This localizes to the left optic nerve.\n\nSecond, the combination of motor and sensory deficits on the right side of the body points to a lesion within the spinal cord. The pattern is highly specific:\n- There are upper motor neuron (UMN) signs in the right leg (spasticity, hyperreflexia, clonus, and an upgoing plantar reflex), indicating damage to the corticospinal tract.\n- There are lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in the right arm (hypoactive biceps reflex and absent supinator reflex), localizing to the C5-C6 spinal cord segments.\n- There is a loss of dorsal column modalities (joint position sense and vibration) on the entire right side. The unsteady, ataxic gait with a positive Romberg sign is a direct consequence of this proprioceptive loss.\n\nA single lesion on the right side of the cervical spinal cord at the C5-C6 level perfectly explains this constellation of ipsilateral findings: it damages the anterior horn cells at that level (causing LMN signs in the C5-C6 myotomes), the descending corticospinal tract (causing UMN signs below the lesion), and the ascending dorsal columns (causing ipsilateral sensory loss). The presence of multiple, spatially distinct lesions in a young adult is characteristic of a demyelinating disease.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Left Optic Nerve\", \"Right C5-C6 Spinal Cord\"]",
