    "response": "1.  **Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n2.  **Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n    *   **Treatment:** High-Dose Intravenous Corticosteroids (e.g., Methylprednisolone 1g daily for 3-5 days)\n    *   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n    *   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** The patient is experiencing a severe, acute, and disabling neurological relapse. Intravenous corticosteroids are the standard of care to reduce the duration and severity of the attack by suppressing the underlying inflammation and restoring the integrity of the blood-brain barrier. Prompt initiation is crucial to hasten recovery and potentially limit residual disability from this event.\n\n    *   **Treatment:** High-Efficacy Disease-Modifying Therapy (DMT) for Multiple Sclerosis\n    *   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n    *   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** While long-term treatment with a DMT is essential, it should be delayed until after the acute relapse is treated and a definitive diagnosis is confirmed. Specifically, investigations must first exclude critical mimics like Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) and Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein Antibody Disease (MOGAD), as some MS DMTs can be ineffective or even harmful in these conditions. Furthermore, initiation requires pre-treatment screening and a thorough discussion with the patient regarding the choice of agent, its risks, and benefits.\n\n    *   **Treatment:** Multidisciplinary Team Rehabilitation (Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy)\n    *   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n    *   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** The patient has significant functional impairments, including gait instability, weakness, and incoordination. Early involvement of rehabilitation services is critical to maximize functional recovery, ensure patient safety (e.g., fall prevention), and provide strategies and equipment to improve independence. This can proceed in parallel with acute medical treatment.\n\n    *   **Treatment:** Symptomatic Management for Spasticity (e.g., Baclofen)\n    *   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n    *   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** The examination reveals spasticity in all four limbs, which can be painful and interfere with mobility and rehabilitation efforts. Initiating a low dose of an anti-spasticity agent and titrating as needed can provide significant symptomatic relief and facilitate more effective participation in physiotherapy.\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"High-Dose Intravenous Corticosteroids\", \"timing\": \"Start Now\", \"reasons\": [\"To reduce the severity and duration of the acute, disabling neurological relapse.\", \"To hasten functional recovery by suppressing acute CNS inflammation.\"]}, {\"treatment\": \"High-Efficacy Disease-Modifying Therapy\", \"timing\": \"Delay\", \"reasons\": [\"A definitive diagnosis must be confirmed and key mimics (e.g., NMOSD, MOGAD) must be excluded, as some DMTs can worsen these conditions.\", \"Requires time for necessary pre-treatment safety screening and comprehensive patient counselling.\"]}, {\"treatment\": \"Multidisciplinary Team Rehabilitation\", \"timing\": \"Start Now\", \"reasons\": [\"To maximize functional recovery from current deficits including gait instability, weakness, and ataxia.\", \"To improve patient safety, prevent falls, and address functional independence early in the disease course.\"]}, {\"treatment\": \"Symptomatic Management for Spasticity\", \"timing\": \"Start Now\", \"reasons\": [\"To provide relief from painful spasticity.\", \"To improve mobility and facilitate more effective engagement in physical therapy.\"]}]",
