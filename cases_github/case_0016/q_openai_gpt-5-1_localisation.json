    "response": "Symmetric spastic quadriparesis with brisk reflexes and extensor plantars indicates involvement of bilateral corticospinal tracts above the cervical cord. Bilateral intention tremor, dysmetria, gait ataxia, and torsional nystagmus point to cerebellar outflow pathway dysfunction via the superior cerebellar peduncles and adjacent brainstem. Severe right and moderate left ptosis with complex ophthalmoplegia and primary position torsional nystagmus localise to the rostral midbrain around the oculomotor nuclear complex and vertical gaze centres. The largely preserved other cranial nerves and cognition argue against more diffuse hemispheric or pontomedullary disease. A single bilateral rostral midbrain lesion affecting the tegmentum and superior cerebellar peduncles parsimoniously explains all findings.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"bilateral rostral midbrain\"]"
