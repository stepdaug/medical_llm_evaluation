    "response": "The clinical picture demonstrates multifocal involvement of the central nervous system disseminated in space. 1) Reduced visual acuity and a Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect (RAPD) on the right indicate a lesion of the Right Optic Nerve. 2) The combination of a Right oculomotor (CN III) palsy (ptosis, mydriasis, ophthalmoplegia) with contralateral (Left) hemiparesis, sensory loss, and cerebellar signs (intention tremor, dysmetria) represents a classical crossed brainstem syndrome (features of Weber's, Benedikt's, and Claude's syndromes). This localizes to the Right Midbrain, affecting the nerve fascicles, corticospinal tract, spinothalamic tract, and red nucleus/cerebellothalamic fibers.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Right Optic Nerve\", \"Right Midbrain\"]"
