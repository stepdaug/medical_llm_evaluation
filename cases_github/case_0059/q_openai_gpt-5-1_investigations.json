Blood tests help exclude metabolic or inflammatory myelopathy and screen for surgical fitness, while CSF and ancillary tests are reserved for non-compressive or demyelinating aetiologies after imaging has ruled out mass effect.\n\ninvestigations = [\"MRI of brain, posterior fossa, cervicomedullary junction and entire cervical spine with gadolinium\", \"MR angiogram of head and neck vessels\", \"CT brain and CT craniocervical junction (if MRI is delayed or contraindicated)\", \"Full blood count\", \"Urea and electrolytes\", \"Liver function tests\", \"Coagulation screen\", \"C-reactive protein\", \"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate\", \"Blood glucose\", \"Vitamin B12 level\", \"Serum folate level\", \"Thyroid function tests\", \"Serum copper level\", \"Serum vitamin E level\", \"Antinuclear antibody (ANA)\", \"Extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) panel\", \"Antiphospholipid antibody panel\", \"Serum aquaporin-4 antibody\", \"Serum myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody\", \"Lumbar puncture with CSF cell count, protein, glucose, culture and oligoclonal bands (after excluding significant mass lesion on imaging)\", \"ECG\", \"Chest X-ray (pre-operative and for malignancy screening)\", \"Visual evoked potentials (if demyelinating disease suspected)\"]"
