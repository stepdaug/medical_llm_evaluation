    "response": "My clinical reasoning for selecting these investigations is as follows: The primary goal is to urgently differentiate between the leading diagnostic possibilities of brainstem encephalitis, demyelination (like MS or NMOSD), and, less likely, tumour or stroke, as treatment for each is vastly different.\n\n1.  **Neuroimaging:** An urgent MRI of the brain and cervical spine with contrast is the most critical first step. It will confirm the presence and precise location of the lesion in the medulla, characterise its features (e.g., inflammatory, demyelinating, neoplastic), and identify any other lesions in the CNS that would support a diagnosis like MS or NMOSD. Contrast enhancement is vital to assess for active inflammation or breakdown of the blood-brain barrier.\n\n2.  **Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Analysis:** A lumbar puncture, performed after imaging has ruled out significant mass effect, is essential. CSF analysis will provide direct evidence of infection (pleocytosis, low glucose, positive cultures/PCR for pathogens like *Listeria* or HSV) or inflammation (oligoclonal bands for MS, elevated protein).\n\n3.  **Blood Tests:** These are crucial to identify systemic signs of infection or inflammation and to test for specific antibodies. Blood cultures are mandatory in a febrile patient with neurological signs to rule out bacteraemia. Specific antibody tests for AQP4 and MOG are necessary to diagnose NMOSD and MOGAD, respectively, which are key mimics of MS and have different prognoses and treatments. Basic blood work (FBC, CRP, electrolytes, liver function) is required for overall patient assessment and to establish a baseline.\n\n4.  **Vascular Imaging:** If the MRI suggests an ischemic stroke, a CT or MR angiogram is necessary to evaluate for an underlying cause like a vertebral artery dissection, which is a consideration in young adults with brainstem syndromes.\n\ninvestigations = [\"MRI of brain and cervical spine with gadolinium contrast\", \"Lumbar Puncture for Cerebrospinal Fluid analysis\", \"Full Blood Count\", \"C-Reactive Protein\", \"Blood Cultures\", \"Urea and Electrolytes\", \"Liver Function Tests\", \"Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody test\", \"Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein (MOG) antibody test\", \"Listeria monocytogenes PCR (from CSF and blood)\", \"Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) PCR (from CSF)\", \"CT Angiography of head and neck vessels\"]",
