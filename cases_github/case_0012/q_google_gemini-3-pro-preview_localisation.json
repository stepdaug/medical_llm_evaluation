    "response": "The clinical presentation is characteristic of a left-sided Brown-S\u00e9quard syndrome (hemicord lesion). This is evidenced by ipsilateral (left-sided) upper motor neuron signs (spasticity, hyperreflexia, upgoing plantar response) and ipsilateral loss of dorsal column sensation (vibration/proprioception), combined with contralateral (right-sided) loss of spinothalamic sensation (pinprick). The presence of weakness in the left wrist extensors (C6/C7 myotome) localises the lesion to the cervical level.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Left Cervical Spinal Cord\"]"
