    "response": "The combination of multifocal neurological deficits (Spinal Cord + Posterior Fossa) and a significantly elevated CRP (145) strongly suggests an infective or acute inflammatory etiology. A spinal epidural abscess is a critical 'must-not-miss' diagnosis given the disc disease history. Inflammatory demyelinating disorders like ADEM or NMOSD are probable given the multifocal nature. Listeria rhombencephalitis is a specific infection that targets the brainstem/cord.\n\ndifferential_diagnosis = [\"Spinal Epidural Abscess\", \"Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM)\", \"Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD)\", \"Listeria Rhombencephalitis\", \"Neurosarcoidosis\", \"CNS Vasculitis\"]"
