    "response": "Initial priority is high-resolution structural imaging to confirm a rostral midbrain lesion, define its extent, and distinguish demyelinating, vascular, and neoplastic causes. Vascular imaging helps detect basilar or superior cerebellar artery disease. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis and targeted blood tests assess for demyelinating, autoimmune, inflammatory, metabolic, and infectious aetiologies. Systemic imaging screens for malignancy or sarcoidosis in suspected paraneoplastic or granulomatous disease. Evoked potentials can demonstrate dissemination in space and time if multiple sclerosis is suspected.\n\ninvestigations = [\"MRI of brain and entire spinal cord with and without gadolinium\", \"Magnetic resonance angiography of intracranial and cervical vessels\", \"Lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid analysis including cell count, protein, glucose, oligoclonal bands, cytology and infectious PCR\", \"Full blood count\", \"Urea and electrolytes\", \"Liver function tests\", \"C-reactive protein\", \"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate\", \"Blood glucose\", \"HbA1c\", \"Lipid profile\", \"Thyroid function tests\", \"Serum vitamin B12\", \"Serum folate\", \"Serum ACE level\", \"Antinuclear antibody\", \"Extractable nuclear antigen panel\", \"Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies\", \"Aquaporin-4 IgG antibodies\", \"Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein IgG antibodies\", \"Paraneoplastic neuronal antibody panel\", \"HIV serology\", \"Syphilis serology\", \"Lyme disease serology\", \"CT of chest, abdomen and pelvis with contrast\", \"Visual evoked potentials\"]"
