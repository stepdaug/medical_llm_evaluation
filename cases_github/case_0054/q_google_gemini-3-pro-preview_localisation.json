    "response": "The patient presents with signs of multifocal neurological dysfunction. The reduced visual acuity and Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect (RAPD) on the right indicate a lesion of the right optic nerve (optic neuritis). The ataxic gait, bidirectional gaze-evoked nystagmus, and right-sided intention tremor indicate a lesion of the cerebellum, specifically the right cerebellar hemisphere and midline structures. The isolated weakness of the left Extensor Hallucis Longus (L5 myotome) with associated sensory loss on the toes (L5 dermatome) and history of sciatica localises to the left L5 nerve root, which is likely a comorbid compressive radiculopathy distinct from the central pathology.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Right Optic Nerve\", \"Right Cerebellum\", \"Left L5 Nerve Root\"]"
