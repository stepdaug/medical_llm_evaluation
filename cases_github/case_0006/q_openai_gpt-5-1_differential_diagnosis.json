    "response": "A young woman with unilateral optic neuropathy and a crossed brainstem syndrome (right cerebellar signs with left pyramidal signs) has multifocal CNS involvement strongly suggestive of an acquired inflammatory demyelinating disorder, most likely relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and neurosarcoidosis are important alternative inflammatory causes because they can produce optic neuritis and brainstem lesions, particularly with abnormal chest imaging. Vascular and neoplastic lesions of the right lateral pons remain structural mimics but are less favoured given age, relative clinical stability, and dissemination of signs in space.\n\ndifferential_diagnosis = [\"Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis\", \"Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder\", \"Neurosarcoidosis\", \"Right lateral pontine ischaemic stroke\", \"Brainstem or cerebellopontine angle tumour\"]"
