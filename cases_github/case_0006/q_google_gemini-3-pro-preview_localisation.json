    "response": "The patient presents with a 'dissemination in space' clinical picture involving three distinct neuroanatomical sites. 1) Right-sided visual loss with a Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect (RAPD) indicates optic neuropathy. 2) Right-sided cerebellar signs (dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesia, nystagmus) localize to the right cerebellum. 3) The motor and sensory findings in the lower limbs suggest a Brown-S\u00e9quard syndrome (hemicord lesion): Left-sided Upper Motor Neuron (UMN) weakness (spasticity, hyperreflexia, upgoing plantar) combined with contralateral (right-sided) spinothalamic sensory loss (pinprick/temperature) localizes to the left side of the spinal cord. The sensory level on the trunk suggests a thoracic level.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Right Optic Nerve\", \"Right Cerebellar Hemisphere\", \"Left Thoracic Spinal Cord\"]"
