    "response": "Urgent brain and vascular imaging is needed to distinguish infarct, haemorrhage and compressive aneurysm/mass, which will direct acute management. Detailed visual pathway assessment helps characterise the optic neuropathy. Baseline bloods and cardiac workup identify vascular risk, stroke mechanisms and contraindications to potential therapies (thrombolysis, anticoagulation, surgery). CSF and autoimmune/infectious tests are reserved for suspected demyelinating or inflammatory causes after mass/aneurysm is excluded.\n\ninvestigations = [\"MRI brain with and without contrast including diffusion-weighted imaging\", \"MR angiography of intracranial and neck vessels\", \"Non-contrast CT brain\", \"CT angiogram of head and neck (if MR angiography not immediately available or to clarify aneurysm anatomy)\", \"Formal ophthalmological assessment including visual acuity, colour vision and dilated fundus examination\", \"Automated visual field testing (perimetry)\", \"Optical coherence tomography of retinal nerve fibre layer\", \"Visual evoked potentials\", \"Electrocardiogram\", \"Transthoracic echocardiogram\", \"Full blood count\", \"Urea and electrolytes\", \"Liver function tests\", \"Coagulation screen\", \"Blood glucose\", \"HbA1c\", \"Lipid profile\", \"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate\", \"C-reactive protein\", \"Serum vitamin B12\", \"Serum folate\", \"Thyroid function tests\", \"Serum ANA\", \"Serum ENA panel\", \"Serum ANCA\", \"Serum ACE level\", \"Serum HIV test\", \"Syphilis serology (RPR and treponemal-specific test)\", \"Lumbar puncture with CSF cell count, protein, glucose, oligoclonal bands and IgG index (after mass lesion and raised intracranial pressure are excluded)\", \"Chest CT or whole-body imaging for occult malignancy if tumour suspected\"]"
