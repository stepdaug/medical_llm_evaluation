    "response": "In a 59-year-old woman with isolated unilateral optic neuropathy and normal systemic observations, the leading possibilities are demyelinating optic neuritis, non-arteritic ischaemic optic neuropathy and compressive optic neuropathy. Age introduces ischaemic and giant cell arteritis-related causes into the differential, while the absence of systemic inflammatory features and a low CRP make arteritic disease somewhat less likely. Toxic, nutritional and hereditary optic neuropathies are less likely but should be considered if initial workup is unrevealing.\n\ndifferential_diagnosis = [\"Demyelinating optic neuritis\", \"Non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy\", \"Compressive optic neuropathy (e.g., optic nerve sheath meningioma or orbital mass)\", \"Arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy secondary to giant cell arteritis\", \"Toxic or nutritional optic neuropathy\", \"Hereditary optic neuropathy (e.g., Leber hereditary optic neuropathy)\"]"
