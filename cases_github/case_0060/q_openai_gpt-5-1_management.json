    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** Inpatient admission with neuro-observations, falls precautions and physiotherapy-led gait training\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Marked gait ataxia and unilateral limb dysmetria place the patient at high risk of falls and injury Inpatient monitoring allows early detection of neurological deterioration while investigations are completed\n\n*   **Treatment:** Optimisation of diabetes control and institution of foot-care measures\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Distal large-fibre sensory loss is consistent with diabetic neuropathy and improved glycaemic control can slow progression Structured foot care reduces risk of ulceration and infection in the setting of reduced sensation\n\n*   **Treatment:** Empiric antibiotic therapy for suspected left lower-lobe pneumonia, tailored to local guidelines\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Chest X-ray shows airspace disease with air bronchograms at the left lung base, compatible with consolidation Early treatment is advisable in a diabetic patient to prevent respiratory and systemic deterioration\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone for a suspected multiple sclerosis relapse\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Should only be started after MRI confirms an acute demyelinating lesion involving the cerebellum or brainstem Active infection and alternative structural diagnoses must be excluded before initiating high-dose steroids\n\n*   **Treatment:** Initiation of long-term disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Requires a definite diagnosis of multiple sclerosis based on McDonald criteria Choice of agent needs multidisciplinary discussion and detailed counselling about benefits and risks\n\n*   **Treatment:** Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin for secondary prevention if imaging confirms cerebellar ischaemic stroke\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Not indicated until ischaemic stroke is proven and haemorrhage is excluded on neuroimaging Dose and duration should follow stroke guidelines and be individualised based on vascular risk\n\n*   **Treatment:** Neurosurgical and oncology referral for resection or radiotherapy if a cerebellar mass lesion is identified\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Definitive management depends on MRI characterisation of any mass lesion Intervention is only appropriate once tumour type, size and resectability are defined\n\n*   **Treatment:** Ophthalmology referral for assessment and management of profound left visual loss\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Left eye has no perception of light with a relative afferent pupillary defect, requiring urgent structural evaluation Early ophthalmic input allows optimisation of diabetic retinopathy or optic neuropathy management and provision of low-vision support\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"Inpatient admission with neuro-observations, falls precautions and
