    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** No\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** Urgent referral to ophthalmology and neurology services\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Isolated unilateral optic neuropathy requires detailed ocular examination and specialised testing not available in routine settings Early assessment can distinguish demyelinating, ischaemic and compressive causes and prevent progression or contralateral involvement\n\n*   **Treatment:** Antiplatelet therapy with low-dose aspirin\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy is a leading consideration in this age group Aspirin provides secondary vascular prevention with low bleeding risk in the absence of contraindications\n\n*   **Treatment:** Management of cardiovascular risk factors including blood pressure optimisation, statin therapy, smoking cessation support and weight management\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Vascular risk factor modification reduces the risk of further ischaemic optic events and stroke These measures are beneficial irrespective of the final aetiology and can be implemented immediately\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone for suspected demyelinating optic neuritis followed by a short oral taper\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Steroids hasten visual recovery in demyelinating optic neuritis but should be started after MRI has excluded a compressive lesion or alternative diagnosis Current findings support optic neuropathy but are not sufficient alone to justify high-dose steroids without imaging\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose systemic corticosteroids for suspected giant cell arteritis\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Normal CRP and absence of reported systemic GCA features make arteritic ischaemic optic neuropathy less likely at present If history, ESR or imaging raise suspicion for giant cell arteritis, corticosteroids should then be started immediately before biopsy\n\n*   **Treatment:** Disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis if diagnostic criteria are met\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Initiation depends on MRI and CSF evidence of dissemination in space and time These agents are long-term therapies aimed at reducing relapse risk rather than acute visual recovery\n\n*   **Treatment:** Surgical or radiotherapy decompression for compressive optic neuropathy\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Requires confirmation of a compressive lesion on MRI and multidisciplinary discussion with neurosurgery and ophthalmology Intervention timing and modality depend on tumour type, size and pace of visual decline\n\n*   **Treatment:** Low-vision aids and visual rehabilitation\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Should be considered after maximal medical and surgical treatment once the degree of permanent visual impairment is clear Improves functional independence if significant visual deficit persists\n\n*   **Treatment:** Patient education about red-flag symptoms and need for urgent reassessment if vision acutely worsens or the fellow eye becomes symptomatic\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Early recognition of deterioration or contralateral involvement is critical for timely escalation of care Empowers the patient to seek immediate help, potentially preventing bilateral or severe visual loss\n\n\ntreatments =
