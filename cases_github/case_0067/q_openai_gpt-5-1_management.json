    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\u20135 days\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Typical disabling optic neuritis with concurrent cerebellar relapse strongly suggests an acute inflammatory demyelinating episode Early IV steroids hasten visual and neurological recovery when given within the first couple of weeks Short-course high-dose steroids are generally safe once sepsis and significant gastrointestinal or metabolic contraindications are excluded\n\n*   **Treatment:** Oral prednisolone taper following IV methylprednisolone\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Commence immediately after completing IV course if no contraindications Helps prevent rebound of symptoms and allows gradual withdrawal of corticosteroids Dose and duration should be individualised based on body weight, diabetes risk, and blood pressure control\n\n*   **Treatment:** Proton pump inhibitor for gastroprotection\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** High-dose systemic steroids increase risk of peptic irritation and ulceration Middle-aged patients have non-trivial baseline gastrointestinal risk PPIs provide effective prophylaxis during and shortly after steroid therapy\n\n*   **Treatment:** Physiotherapy and occupational therapy for gait and limb ataxia\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Gait ataxia and left upper limb dysmetria increase fall risk and impair daily activities Early balance and coordination training improves functional outcomes Therapists can advise on home safety measures and assistive devices\n\n*   **Treatment:** Initiation of disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis if diagnostic criteria are met (e.g., ocrelizumab, natalizumab, interferon beta, or other appropriate agent)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Requires confirmation of multiple sclerosis based on MRI and CSF findings and evidence of dissemination in time and space Choice of agent depends on disease activity, comorbidities, pregnancy plans, and patient preference Baseline screening for infections, vaccination review, and counselling about risks and monitoring are essential before starting\n\n*   **Treatment:** Long-term immunosuppressive maintenance therapy tailored to antibody status if NMOSD or MOG antibody-associated disease is diagnosed (e.g., rituximab, azathioprine, mycophenolate, satralizumab)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Indicated only if investigations show aquaporin-4 or MOG antibodies or characteristic imaging pattern Therapy choice must consider efficacy, relapse prevention, and side-effect profile Requires detailed counselling and regular monitoring of blood counts, liver function, and infection risk\n\n*   **Treatment:** Low-molecular-weight heparin thromboprophylaxis during any inpatient stay\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Ataxia and unsteady gait may limit mobility, increasing venous thromboembolism risk in hospital Pharmacologic prophylaxis is low risk in the absence of bleeding diathesis Widely recommended for neurologically impaired inpatients with reduced mobility\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\\u20135
