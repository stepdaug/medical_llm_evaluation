    "response": "Based on the clinical findings, the patient presents with a subacute (7-day onset), symmetrical, length-dependent sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Key features supporting this are the distal weakness (greater in the legs than hands), the \"stocking-glove\" pattern of sensory loss affecting all modalities, and the areflexia in the lower limbs. This constellation points towards a diffuse process affecting the peripheral nerves. The differential diagnosis is prioritised based on the acuity of onset.\n\n1.  **Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS):** This is the most likely diagnosis. The acute to subacute onset (days to weeks) of progressive, relatively symmetric weakness accompanied by areflexia and sensory symptoms is the hallmark of GBS. The patient's presentation fits this classic pattern perfectly. The normal inflammatory markers and absence of fever are also consistent with this post-infectious autoimmune condition.\n\n2.  **Toxic Polyneuropathy:** Acute exposure to certain neurotoxins can cause a rapid-onset, symmetrical, length-dependent polyneuropathy. This could include heavy metals (e.g., arsenic, lead), industrial solvents, or certain medications. This diagnosis is important to consider in any acute polyneuropathy, pending a detailed history of exposures.\n\n3.  **Vasculitic Neuropathy:** While often presenting as an asymmetric mononeuritis multiplex, systemic vasculitis can sometimes cause a subacute, confluent, and symmetric polyneuropathy. This is less likely given the absence of systemic symptoms (like fever or rash) and normal inflammatory markers (CRP), but it remains a consideration in the differential of a subacute sensorimotor neuropathy.\n\n4.  **Acute Presentation of a Metabolic Neuropathy:** Although typically chronic, metabolic causes like diabetes or vitamin deficiencies can rarely present more acutely, or an acute illness can unmask an underlying neuropathy. The patient's obesity is a risk factor for diabetes. While the random glucose is normal, this does not fully exclude the diagnosis, which would require an HbA1c. However, the 7-day onset makes a chronic metabolic cause less probable as the primary explanation.\n\ndifferential_diagnosis = [\"Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome\", \"Toxic Polyneuropathy\", \"Vasculitic Neuropathy\", \"Acute Presentation of a Metabolic Neuropathy\"]",
