    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** Admission to a neurology or stroke unit with close neurological observation\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Brainstem lesions can deteriorate rapidly affecting consciousness, breathing and swallowing Allows frequent neurological observations and rapid access to imaging and specialist input\n\n*   **Treatment:** Swallow assessment and nil-by-mouth until assessed\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Brainstem involvement increases risk of silent aspiration even if speech and palate appear normal Early swallow assessment reduces pneumonia risk and guides safe route for nutrition and medications\n\n*   **Treatment:** Intermittent pneumatic compression devices for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Hemiparesis and reduced mobility increase risk of deep vein thrombosis Mechanical prophylaxis is safe before intracranial haemorrhage has been excluded\n\n*   **Treatment:** Physiotherapy, occupational therapy and early neurorehabilitation\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Early mobilisation and task-specific therapy improve functional recovery after focal brain lesions Helps prevent contractures, deconditioning and falls related to ataxia and weakness\n\n*   **Treatment:** Proton pump inhibitor therapy for gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Patient\u2019s presenting heartburn and acid taste are symptomatic and easily treatable Reducing reflux may lessen aspiration risk if swallowing becomes impaired\n\n*   **Treatment:** Pharmacologic venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Anticoagulation could worsen an unrecognised brainstem haemorrhage or bleeding cavernoma Should be started only after MRI/CT has excluded haemorrhage and neurosurgical lesions\n\n*   **Treatment:** Aspirin 300 mg daily followed by 75 mg daily\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** If imaging confirms an ischaemic pontine stroke, early antiplatelet therapy reduces recurrence risk Must be delayed until intracranial haemorrhage, cavernoma with recent bleed or major tumour are excluded on imaging\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-intensity statin therapy (e.g., atorvastatin 80 mg nightly)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Indicated for secondary prevention if ischaemic stroke is confirmed Should follow confirmation of vascular aetiology and baseline liver function testing\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone for 3\u20135 days\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Shortens relapse duration in an acute demyelinating brainstem lesion such as multiple sclerosis Should only be commenced once MRI/CSF strongly support demyelination and active infection has been excluded\n\n*   **Treatment:** Long-term disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Requires definite diagnosis of multiple sclerosis based on clinical and radiological criteria Choice of agent depends on disease activity, comorbidities and patient preference and is not an emergency decision\n\n*   **Treatment:** Neurosurgical or radiosurgical consultation for cavernous malformation or intrinsic pontine tumour if identified\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Surgical or radiosurgical management depends on precise imaging diagnosis and risk\u2013benefit assessment Intervention is usually elective unless there is life-threatening mass effect or repeated haemorrhage\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"Admission to a neurology or stroke unit with close neurological observation\", \"timing\":
