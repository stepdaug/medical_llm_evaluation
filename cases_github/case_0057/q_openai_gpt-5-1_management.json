    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** Intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\u20135 days followed by a short oral prednisolone taper\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** First-line therapy for acute inflammatory demyelinating optic neuritis Can hasten visual recovery even though final visual outcome may be similar without treatment Helps treat potential NMOSD or MOG-antibody\u2013associated optic neuritis where early immunosuppression is important No evidence from current data of active infection or other contraindications to high-dose steroids\n\n*   **Treatment:** Proton pump inhibitor for gastric protection while receiving high-dose corticosteroids\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** High-dose intravenous and oral steroids increase risk of gastritis and peptic ulcer disease Simple measure to reduce upper gastrointestinal adverse events during steroid course\n\n*   **Treatment:** Monitoring and prophylaxis for steroid-related adverse effects (blood pressure and blood glucose monitoring, venous thromboembolism risk assessment and prophylaxis as appropriate)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** High-dose steroids can precipitate hypertension and hyperglycaemia even in young patients Identifying VTE risk early allows timely prophylaxis during reduced mobility or hospitalisation\n\n*   **Treatment:** Initiation of disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis if diagnostic criteria are subsequently met\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Requires confirmation of dissemination in time and space on MRI and/or CSF before starting long-term therapy Choice of agent should follow multidisciplinary discussion in an MS service and incorporate patient preferences and risk profile\n\n*   **Treatment:** Long-term immunosuppressive therapy for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder or MOG-antibody\u2013associated disease (e.g., rituximab, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Should only be commenced once antibody testing and imaging confirm NMOSD or MOGAD Requires pre-treatment infection screening and detailed counselling about risks and monitoring\n\n*   **Treatment:** Therapeutic plasma exchange\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Reserved for severe optic neuritis with marked visual loss that fails to improve after 3\u20135 days of high-dose intravenous steroids Invasive therapy with significant resource use and risk, not indicated while vision is only moderately impaired and initial steroid response is unknown\n\n*   **Treatment:** Referral for visual rehabilitation services and low-vision aids if significant deficit persists\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Appropriate only after the degree of permanent visual loss is clear following recovery period Helps optimise functional adaptation and quality of life if visual recovery is incomplete\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"Intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\\u20135 days followed by a short oral prednisolone taper\", \"timing\":
