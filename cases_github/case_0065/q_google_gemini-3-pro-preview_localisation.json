    "response": "The patient presents with two distinct clinical syndromes indicating multifocal pathology within the central nervous system. Firstly, the reduced visual acuity and Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect (RAPD) on the left indicate a pre-chiasmal lesion. Secondly, the right-sided spastic hemiparesis (hypertonia, hyperreflexia, pyramidal weakness, extensor plantar) combined with right-sided hemi-sensory loss (involving both spinothalamic and dorsal column modalities) localises to the left hemisphere. Because the face is spared and both motor and sensory tracts are densely involved, the lesion is best localised to the subcortical white matter where these tracts converge.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Left Optic Nerve\", \"Left Internal Capsule\"]"
