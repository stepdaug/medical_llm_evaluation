    "response": "Subacute unilateral reduction in visual acuity with a left relative afferent pupillary defect and otherwise normal ocular motility localises to the left optic nerve. Very mild distal-predominant weakness in the left wrist extensors and ankle dorsiflexors, with normal tone, reflexes and sensation, is most consistent with a small contralateral supratentorial corticospinal lesion, likely in the primary motor cortex.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"left optic nerve\", \"right primary motor cortex\"]"
