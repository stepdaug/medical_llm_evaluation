    "response": "The clinical presentation is dominated by bilateral cranial nerve III palsies (ptosis, ophthalmoparesis affecting elevation, depression, and adduction with spared abduction), cerebellar signs (torsional nystagmus, intention tremor, ataxia), and bilateral upper motor neuron signs (spasticity, hyperreflexia, clonus, extensor plantars). This constellation of signs localises to the midbrain, specifically involving the oculomotor nuclear complex/fascicles, superior cerebellar peduncles, and corticospinal tracts.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Bilateral Midbrain\"]"
