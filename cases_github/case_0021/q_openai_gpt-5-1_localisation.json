    "response": "Right ptosis with dilated pupil and ophthalmoplegia, together with primary position downbeat nystagmus, contralateral (left) spastic hemiparesis and hyperreflexia, left Babinski sign, left limb ataxia and intention tremor, and left-sided loss of vibration/joint position with preserved pinprick are best explained by a single right paramedian midbrain lesion involving the oculomotor fascicles, cerebral peduncle, medial lemniscus and superior cerebellar peduncle (Weber/Benedikt-type syndrome). The marked reduction of right visual acuity with a right RAPD is not accounted for by this and indicates an additional right optic nerve lesion.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"right midbrain\", \"right optic nerve\"]"
