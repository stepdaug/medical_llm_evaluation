    "response": "The neurological examination is essentially normal. The isolated finding of mild (4+/5) weakness in right knee flexion is not accompanied by sensory loss or reflex changes (ankle jerks are preserved), which makes a structural lumbosacral radiculopathy or sciatic neuropathy highly unlikely. The cranial nerve, sensory, and coordination examinations are unremarkable. Given the history of migraine and the lack of objective focal deficits, the clinical presentation does not localise to a specific structural lesion but rather suggests a functional or biochemical etiology.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Unspecified Neuroanatomical Location\"]"
