    "response": "Urgent neuroimaging is required to confirm the anatomical localisation and characteristic appearance of demyelination vs compression. MRI of the brain and whole spine with contrast is the gold standard. Blood tests are necessary to exclude metabolic mimics (B12), infectious causes (HIV, Syphilis, Lyme), and to test for specific biomarkers (AQP4, MOG) that differentiate MS from NMO/MOGAD, as this dictates long-term management. A lumbar puncture is indicated to detect oligoclonal bands, which supports a diagnosis of MS.\n\ninvestigations = [\"MRI Brain with and without gadolinium contrast\", \"MRI Cervical and Thoracic Spine with and without gadolinium contrast\", \"Full blood count\", \"Urea and electrolytes\", \"Liver function tests\", \"C-reactive protein\", \"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate\", \"Serum Glucose\", \"Vitamin B12 and Folate\", \"Thyroid function tests\", \"Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibodies\", \"Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein (MOG) antibodies\", \"Antinuclear antibodies (ANA)\", \"Extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) panel\", \"HIV serology\", \"Syphilis serology\", \"Lyme disease serology\", \"Lumbar Puncture (for CSF analysis and oligoclonal bands)\", \"Visual Evoked Potentials\"]"
