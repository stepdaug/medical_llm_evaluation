    "response": "Subacute onset over about 10 days with persistence over weeks and a purely cerebellar syndrome in a 61-year-old man raises concern for a structural lesion of the right cerebellar hemisphere. Vascular causes (infarct, less likely haemorrhage) are common and can present subacutely. Tumours (primary or metastatic) and demyelination can also cause a focal cerebellar syndrome of this tempo. Immune/paraneoplastic cerebellitis and toxic-metabolic causes are broader considerations but are less consistent with the strictly unilateral, focal findings.\n\ndifferential_diagnosis = [\"Right posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) or superior cerebellar artery territory cerebellar infarction\", \"Right cerebellar tumour (primary cerebellar neoplasm or metastatic lesion)\", \"Right cerebellar haemorrhage\", \"Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis with right cerebellar plaque\", \"Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration\", \"Alcohol-related cerebellar degeneration\", \"Autoimmune or post-infectious cerebellitis\"]"
