    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\u20135 days\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Standard first-line therapy for an acute, functionally significant CNS demyelinating relapse Aims to reduce inflammation and shorten the duration and severity of neurological deficits Risk\u2013benefit profile is favourable in a young patient once active infection and contraindications are excluded\n\n*   **Treatment:** Proton pump inhibitor during and shortly after high-dose steroid therapy\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Reduces risk of steroid-induced gastric irritation or peptic ulceration Patient will receive several days of high-dose corticosteroids\n\n*   **Treatment:** Thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin and graduated compression stockings\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Spastic tetraparesis and reduced mobility increase venous thromboembolism risk High-dose steroids may further increase thrombotic risk\n\n*   **Treatment:** Targeted antibiotic therapy for urinary tract infection\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Urinalysis shows leucocytes and blood suggesting urinary tract infection Active infection should be treated before or alongside high-dose immunosuppression to reduce sepsis risk\n\n*   **Treatment:** Neurology-led multidisciplinary rehabilitation (physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and speech and language therapy)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Spastic tetraparesis, gait ataxia and bulbar signs require early rehabilitation to prevent contractures and aspiration and to maximise functional recovery Supports gait training, balance, activities of daily living and swallowing/communication assessment\n\n*   **Treatment:** Oral antispasticity agents such as baclofen or tizanidine\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Assess response to steroids and physiotherapy first, as spasticity may improve with remission Initiate if clinically significant spasticity persists and impairs function or causes pain\n\n*   **Treatment:** Disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis (e.g. ocrelizumab, natalizumab or other agent according to risk stratification)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Requires firm diagnosis of multiple sclerosis with MRI and CSF evidence of dissemination in time and space Needs baseline infection screening, vaccination review and detailed discussion of risks and benefits with the patient Choice of agent should be individualised in a specialist MS clinic\n\n*   **Treatment:** Plasma exchange\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Reserved for severe demyelinating relapses not responding adequately to high-dose steroids Invasive treatment with significant risks, so only indicated if there is persistent, disabling deficit after initial therapy\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\\u20135 days\", \"timing\": \"Start Now\",
