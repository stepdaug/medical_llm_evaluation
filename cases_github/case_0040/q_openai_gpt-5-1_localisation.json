    "response": "There is a clear upper motor neuron pattern confined to the right lower limb (spasticity, marked weakness, brisk knee and ankle reflexes, extensor plantar) with entirely normal upper limbs and face, localising the central motor lesion to the left medial frontal lobe leg area or its descending fibres above the internal capsule. The positive Romberg sign, unsteady gait with preserved heel\u2013shin testing, and distal, roughly symmetrical impairment of vibration and joint position sense in both feet without a sensory level indicate a length-dependent large-fibre peripheral polyneuropathy rather than a focal spinal cord lesion. The unilateral reduction in right visual acuity with a right RAPD and otherwise normal ocular motility and cranial nerves localises to the right optic nerve anterior to the chiasm. These three sites are the minimum number of distinct lesions required to explain all findings.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"left medial frontal lobe (paracentral lobule)\", \"bilateral length-dependent peripheral polyneuropathy\", \"right optic nerve\"]"
