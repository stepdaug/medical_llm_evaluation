    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** Intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\u20135 days\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Standard first-line therapy for acute demyelinating optic neuritis to accelerate visual recovery May reduce risk of severe permanent visual loss if this is NMOSD-associated optic neuritis Patient has no signs of systemic infection or contraindications in initial workup\n\n*   **Treatment:** Oral prednisolone taper for 1\u20132 weeks following IV methylprednisolone\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Commenced after completion of IV steroid course to reduce rebound and allow gradual withdrawal Exact dose and duration should be individualised once initial response and diagnosis are clarified\n\n*   **Treatment:** Proton pump inhibitor for gastroprotection during high-dose steroid therapy\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** High-dose corticosteroids increase risk of gastritis and peptic ulcer disease Patient has no contraindications to PPI use\n\n*   **Treatment:** Calcium and vitamin D supplementation during and after corticosteroid therapy\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Reduces steroid-associated bone demineralisation risk Safe and low-cost preventive measure in a young woman who may require future steroid courses\n\n*   **Treatment:** Urgent neuro-ophthalmology and ophthalmology follow-up\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Needed for detailed visual assessment, monitoring of response, and exclusion of primary retinal or compressive pathology Facilitates coordinated care with neurology regarding demyelinating disease workup\n\n*   **Treatment:** Initiation of disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis (e.g., interferon-beta, glatiramer acetate, or higher-efficacy agent as indicated)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Should only be started once MRI and CSF meet diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis Choice of agent depends on lesion burden, prognostic factors, comorbidities, and patient preference\n\n*   **Treatment:** Long-term immunosuppressive therapy for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (e.g., rituximab, azathioprine, or mycophenolate)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Reserved for patients with positive aquaporin-4 antibodies or strong clinical and radiological suspicion of NMOSD Requires confirmation of diagnosis and assessment of infection risk and vaccination status before initiation\n\n*   **Treatment:** Counselling on prognosis, risk of multiple sclerosis, and safety including driving advice\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Patient needs to understand the possibility of MS or related conditions and implications for future health Current unilateral visual acuity reduction may temporarily impair driving safety depending on local regulations\n\n*   **Treatment:** Cardiovascular risk factor assessment and optimisation (e.g., blood pressure, lipids, smoking cessation) if ischaemic optic neuropathy suspected\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Ischaemic optic neuropathy is less likely given age and presentation but should be addressed if investigations support this diagnosis Interventions can be planned after diagnostic clarification rather than emergently\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"Intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\\u20135 days\", \"timing\": \"Start Now\", \"reasons\":
