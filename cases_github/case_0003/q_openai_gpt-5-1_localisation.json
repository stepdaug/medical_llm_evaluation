    "response": "Left relative afferent pupillary defect with reduced visual acuity indicates a left optic neuropathy. Severe left ptosis, fixed dilated pupil and multidirectional ophthalmoplegia are consistent with a left oculomotor nerve fascicular lesion. Mild right ptosis with miosis suggests a right Horner syndrome. Palate deviation to the left and tongue deviation to the right indicate right nucleus ambiguus and hypoglossal involvement. Bidirectional gaze-evoked nystagmus, right-sided dysdiadochokinesia, unsteady gait, bilateral limb spasticity with brisk reflexes, extensor plantars and predominantly right-sided sensory disturbance point to involvement of brainstem long tracts and cerebellar connections. The pattern is best explained by multiple discrete CNS lesions: a left optic nerve lesion, a left dorsal midbrain lesion involving the oculomotor fascicles, red nucleus/superior cerebellar peduncle and adjacent corticospinal and sensory pathways, and a right dorsolateral medullary lesion involving sympathetic fibres, nucleus ambiguus, hypoglossal nucleus and neighbouring long tracts.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"left optic nerve\", \"left dorsal midbrain\", \"right dorsolateral medulla\"]"
