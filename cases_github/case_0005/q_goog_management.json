    "response": "1.  **Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n2.  **Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n    *   **Treatment:** High-Dose Intravenous Corticosteroids (e.g., Methylprednisolone 1g daily for 3-5 days)\n    *   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n    *   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** The patient is experiencing an acute, functionally disabling relapse involving both vision and coordination (optic neuritis and cerebellar ataxia). The primary goal of high-dose corticosteroids is to hasten recovery by reducing the inflammation associated with the acute demyelinating event. Delaying treatment would prolong the period of disability.\n\n    *   **Treatment:** Disease-Modifying Therapy (DMT) for Multiple Sclerosis\n    *   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n    *   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** While the presentation is highly suggestive of MS, it is imperative to first confirm the diagnosis and, most importantly, exclude critical mimics like Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) and MOG Antibody Disease (MOGAD) through serological testing. Some MS DMTs can be ineffective or even harmful in these conditions. The choice of a specific long-term DMT requires full investigation results (MRI, bloods, +/- CSF) and a thorough discussion with the patient about risks, benefits, and monitoring (shared decision-making), which should occur after the acute phase is managed.\n\n    *   **Treatment:** Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy\n    *   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n    *   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** The patient has significant gait ataxia and appendicular dysmetria, which impairs mobility and safety. Early referral to rehabilitation services is crucial to provide strategies for managing symptoms, improving balance, preventing falls, and maximizing functional recovery. This can proceed concurrently with acute medical treatment.\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"High-Dose Intravenous Corticosteroids\", \"timing\": \"Start Now\", \"reasons\": [\"To reduce the severity and duration of the acute disabling relapse.\", \"The patient has functionally significant deficits including optic neuritis and cerebellar ataxia.\"]}, {\"treatment\": \"Disease-Modifying Therapy (DMT) for Multiple Sclerosis\", \"timing\": \"Delay\", \"reasons\": [\"A definitive diagnosis must be established and key mimics (NMOSD, MOGAD) must be excluded via serology first.\", \"Choice of DMT depends on full investigation results and a shared decision-making process with the patient.\"]}, {\"treatment\": \"Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy\", \"timing\": \"Start Now\", \"reasons\": [\"To address the significant gait and limb ataxia.\", \"To improve safety, prevent falls, and maximise functional recovery during and after the acute relapse.\"]}]",
