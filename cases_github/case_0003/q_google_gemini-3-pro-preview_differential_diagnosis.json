This is the classic presentation of an inflammatory demyelinating disease. Multiple Sclerosis is the most probable cause. NMOSD and MOGAD are critical differentials due to the specific combination of optic neuritis and brainstem manifestations. Inflammatory mimics like Sarcoidosis or Vasculitis are less likely but must be considered.\n\ndifferential_diagnosis = [\"Multiple Sclerosis (MS)\", \"Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD)\", \"MOG Antibody Disease (MOGAD)\", \"Neurosarcoidosis\", \"CNS Vasculitis\", \"Brainstem Encephalitis (e.g., Listeria, Lyme disease)\"]"
