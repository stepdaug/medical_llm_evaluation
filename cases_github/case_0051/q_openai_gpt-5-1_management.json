    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** Admit to hyperacute stroke unit with airway, breathing and circulation optimisation\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Brainstem involvement carries high risk of rapid deterioration in respiration, bulbar function and consciousness Close neurological and cardiorespiratory monitoring is required to detect complications early and allow timely intervention\n\n*   **Treatment:** Intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Clinical picture is of a disabling ischaemic stroke within the treatment time window Non-contrast CT brain has excluded intracranial haemorrhage and there are no major contraindications\n\n*   **Treatment:** Endovascular thrombectomy of basilar or vertebral artery if large-vessel occlusion is demonstrated\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Large-vessel posterior circulation occlusion benefits from rapid mechanical reperfusion Timely thrombectomy offers the best chance of salvaging brainstem tissue and improving outcome\n\n*   **Treatment:** Aspirin 300 mg followed by long-term antiplatelet therapy\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** If thrombolysis is administered, antiplatelets should be withheld for 24 hours and until repeat imaging excludes haemorrhagic transformation If thrombolysis is not given, aspirin can be started immediately after haemorrhage is excluded on imaging\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-intensity statin therapy\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Statins are recommended after ischaemic stroke for secondary prevention regardless of baseline cholesterol in most patients Can be initiated once baseline liver function tests are known\n\n*   **Treatment:** Blood pressure optimisation with intravenous or oral antihypertensives as needed\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Severe hypertension increases risk of haemorrhagic transformation, whereas hypotension worsens cerebral perfusion Blood pressure targets differ depending on whether thrombolysis or thrombectomy is performed and must be actively managed\n\n*   **Treatment:** Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with intermittent pneumatic compression and early mobilisation\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Hemiparesis and reduced mobility substantially increase risk of venous thromboembolism Mechanical prophylaxis is safe immediately even after acute stroke and thrombolysis\n\n*   **Treatment:** Physiotherapy and occupational therapy rehabilitation programme\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Early multidisciplinary rehabilitation improves functional recovery and independence after stroke Prevents complications such as contractures, deconditioning and falls\n\n*   **Treatment:** Speech and language therapy assessment including swallow evaluation\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Brainstem and facial nerve involvement increase the risk of dysphagia and aspiration pneumonia Assessment determines safety of oral intake and the need for modified diets or enteral feeding\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone followed by disease-modifying therapy if multiple sclerosis is confirmed\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Steroids are indicated only if MRI and cerebrospinal fluid findings indicate an acute demyelinating lesion rather than ischaemic stroke Therapy should begin after exclusion of active infection and in consultation with a neuroimmunology team\n\n*   **Treatment:** Referral to neurosurgery or neuro-oncology for consideration of biopsy or resection if a brainstem tumour or cavernous malformation is identified\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Definitive management of neoplastic or cavernous lesions depends on imaging, clinical course and operative risk Interventions are typically planned electively after full diagnostic work-up and multidisciplinary discussion\n\n*   **Treatment:** Long-term secondary prevention including smoking cessation, optimisation of blood pressure, lipid and glucose control, and lifestyle modification\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Addressing vascular risk factors significantly reduces the risk of recurrent stroke These measures are instituted once the patient is medically stable and has a confirmed aetiological diagnosis\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"Admit to hyperacute stroke unit with airway, breathing and circulation
