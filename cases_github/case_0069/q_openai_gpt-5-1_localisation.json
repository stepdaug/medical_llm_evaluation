    "response": "Right-sided spastic weakness of arm and leg with brisk reflexes and extensor plantar, in the absence of cranial nerve signs, indicates an upper motor neuron lesion below the brainstem. Sensory findings of ipsilateral impairment of joint position/vibration with contralateral pinprick loss and positive Romberg are characteristic of a Brown-S\u00e9quard pattern. This most parsimoniously localises to a right hemicord lesion of the cervical spinal cord.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"right cervical spinal cord\"]"
