    "response": "A young-middle-aged woman with subacute unilateral optic neuropathy and cerebellar signs strongly suggests central inflammatory demyelination, particularly relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis; other demyelinating disorders (NMOSD, MOGAD) and systemic inflammatory or metabolic causes must be excluded. The distal symmetric sensory loss raises possibilities of a coexisting peripheral neuropathy (e.g., diabetic, B12-deficient or paraproteinaemic), while the unilateral L5 weakness is most consistent with a lumbar radiculopathy related to sciatica.\n\ndifferential_diagnosis = [\"Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis\", \"Central nervous system demyelination not yet fulfilling criteria for multiple sclerosis (clinically isolated syndrome)\", \"Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder\", \"MOG-antibody associated disease\", \"Central nervous system involvement of systemic autoimmune disease (e.g., neurosarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus)\", \"Vitamin B12 deficiency with myelopathy, optic neuropathy and peripheral neuropathy\", \"Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration with sensory neuropathy\", \"Length-dependent peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance\", \"Paraproteinaemic peripheral neuropathy\", \"Left L5 radiculopathy due to lumbar intervertebral disc herniation\"]"
