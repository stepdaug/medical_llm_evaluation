treatment should not be delayed once blood has been drawn for diagnostic levels Hydroxocobalamin is safe and well tolerated even if vitamin B12 deficiency is not ultimately confirmed\n\n*   **Treatment:** Empiric antibiotic therapy for community-acquired pneumonia\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Chest X-ray demonstrates consolidation consistent with pneumonia Prompt antimicrobial therapy reduces risk of respiratory compromise and systemic sepsis Treating systemic infection may also prevent worsening of neurological status and facilitate rehabilitation\n\n*   **Treatment:** Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin and mechanical measures\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Lower-limb weakness and reduced mobility increase risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism No obvious contraindications to pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis are currently apparent\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone for suspected inflammatory demyelinating myelitis\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Should be initiated only after MRI and CSF studies exclude compressive lesions and active infection such as epidural abscess or untreated pneumonia Reserved for cases where imaging or CSF show features of multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, MOG antibody-associated disease, or related inflammatory myelitis\n\n*   **Treatment:** Long-term cause-specific therapy (e.g., lifelong vitamin B12 replacement, copper supplementation, antiretroviral therapy, or disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Requires definitive diagnosis from metabolic, infectious, autoimmune, and imaging workup Choice of regimen, dosing, and monitoring must be individualised once the underlying aetiology is established\n\n*   **Treatment:** Physiotherapy and occupational therapy for gait training, spasticity management, and falls prevention\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Best commenced once acute investigations are completed and the patient is medically stable Rehabilitation is essential for functional recovery, optimisation of mobility, and safe discharge planning\n\n*   **Treatment:** Provision of mobility aids and home safety adaptations\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Specific aids should be selected after formal physiotherapy and occupational therapy assessment Aims to reduce long-term fall risk and improve independence if residual neurological deficits persist\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"Hospital admission under neurology with urgent spinal-cord workup and fall precautions\", \"timing\": \"Start Now\", \"reasons\": [\"Objective upper motor neuron signs in the right leg indicate spinal cord involvement requiring close monitoring\", \"Unsteady gait and positive Romberg sign confer high immediate fall risk\", \"Inpatient care allows rapid MRI, timely investigations, and multidisciplinary assessment\"]}, {\"treatment\": \"Parenteral vitamin B12 replacement (intramuscular hydroxocobalamin)\", \"timing\": \"Start Now\", \"reasons\": [\"Clinical picture is highly suggestive of subacute combined degeneration affecting dorsal and lateral spinal columns\", \"Neurological injury from vitamin B12 deficiency can become irreversible;
