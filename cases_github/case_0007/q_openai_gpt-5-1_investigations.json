    "response": "Imaging is required urgently to confirm a left midbrain lesion, differentiate infarct from demyelination, haemorrhage, or tumour, and assess cerebral vasculature. Blood tests evaluate vascular risk factors and exclude systemic inflammatory, autoimmune, or infectious causes. CSF analysis and neurophysiological ophthalmic tests help confirm demyelinating optic neuropathy. Cardiac and large-vessel studies look for an embolic source if stroke is confirmed.\n\ninvestigations = [\"MRI of brain with diffusion-weighted imaging and gadolinium contrast, including dedicated midbrain and orbital sequences\", \"MR angiogram of intracranial and neck vessels\", \"CT brain without contrast (if MRI is contraindicated or not immediately available)\", \"Full blood count\", \"Urea and electrolytes\", \"Liver function tests\", \"Coagulation screen\", \"Blood glucose\", \"HbA1c\", \"Fasting lipid profile\", \"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate\", \"C-reactive protein\", \"Antinuclear antibody\", \"Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies\", \"Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme level\", \"Aquaporin-4 IgG antibody\", \"Myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody\", \"Serum vitamin B12\", \"Serum folate\", \"HIV antibody and antigen test\", \"Syphilis serology\", \"Lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid analysis including cell count, protein, glucose, oligoclonal bands, cytology, and infectious PCR panel\", \"Visual evoked potentials\", \"Optical coherence tomography of the retinal nerve fibre layer\", \"ECG\", \"Transthoracic echocardiogram\", \"Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring\", \"Carotid and vertebral artery Doppler ultrasound\"]"
