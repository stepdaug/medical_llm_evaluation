    "response": "A subacute Brown-S\u00e9quard cervical myelopathy in a middle-aged woman is most suggestive of an intrinsic inflammatory/demyelinating lesion such as multiple sclerosis, but compressive pathology must be urgently excluded because it is time-critical. The recent respiratory illness and raised CRP widen the differential to include infectious and post-infectious myelitis, while vascular and granulomatous causes are less likely but important alternatives.\n\ndifferential_diagnosis = [\"Multiple sclerosis with right cervical spinal cord plaque\", \"Right cervical spinal cord compression due to intradural extramedullary tumour (e.g., meningioma)\", \"Right cervical epidural abscess\", \"Post-infectious acute transverse myelitis (partial right cervical myelitis)\", \"Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder\", \"Cervical spinal cord infarction due to vertebral or anterior spinal artery occlusion\", \"Neurosarcoidosis involving the cervical spinal cord\"]"
