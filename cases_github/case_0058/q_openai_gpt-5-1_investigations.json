    "response": "Urgent MRI is required to define the right pontine lesion and optic nerve involvement and to distinguish demyelination from infarction or tumour, which critically informs acute therapy. CSF studies and evoked potentials help confirm inflammatory demyelination and exclude infection. Nerve conduction studies characterise the distal sensory loss. Blood tests screen for vascular risk, nutritional deficiency, autoimmune and granulomatous disease, and treatable infections. Urine culture is necessary before starting immunosuppression in the context of leucocyturia.\n\ninvestigations = [\"MRI of brain and orbits with gadolinium contrast\", \"MRI of cervical and thoracic spine with gadolinium contrast\", \"Lumbar puncture with CSF cell count, protein, glucose, culture, cytology and oligoclonal bands\", \"Visual evoked potentials\", \"Nerve conduction studies and electromyography\", \"Full blood count\", \"Urea and electrolytes\", \"Liver function tests\", \"C-reactive protein\", \"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate\", \"Blood glucose\", \"HbA1c\", \"Serum vitamin B12\", \"Serum folate\", \"Thyroid-stimulating hormone\", \"Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation\", \"Antinuclear antibody\", \"Extractable nuclear antigen panel\", \"Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies\", \"Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme level\", \"Serum aquaporin-4 IgG antibodies\", \"Serum myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibodies\", \"HIV antibody and antigen test\", \"Syphilis serology\", \"Urine culture and sensitivity\", \"High-resolution CT chest\", \"ECG\"]"
