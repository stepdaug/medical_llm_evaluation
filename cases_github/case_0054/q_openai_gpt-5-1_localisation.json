    "response": "Right reduced visual acuity with right RAPD localises to the right optic nerve. Bidirectional gaze-evoked horizontal nystagmus, right-sided intention tremor, ataxic and unstable tandem gait with a negative Romberg indicate a cerebellar rather than sensory cause of ataxia, best localised to the right cerebellum. Symmetric distal impairment of multiple sensory modalities in both feet suggests a bilateral length-dependent peripheral polyneuropathy. Isolated weakness of left great toe extension with normal tone, reflexes and other myotomes, in a patient with sciatica, localises to the left L5 nerve root.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"right optic nerve\", \"right cerebellum\", \"bilateral length-dependent peripheral polyneuropathy\", \"left L5 nerve root\"]"
