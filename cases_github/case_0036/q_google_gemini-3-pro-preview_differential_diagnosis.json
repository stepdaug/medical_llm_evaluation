    "response": "In a 60-year-old female, the differential for acute/subacute unilateral optic neuropathy is broad. Optic Neuritis (idiopathic, MS-associated, or antibody-mediated like NMOSD/MOGAD) is a primary consideration, though the age is slightly older than typical MS onset. Non-Arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION) is highly probable given the age group, despite the lack of listed vascular risk factors. Compressive lesions (meningioma) must be ruled out. Giant Cell Arteritis is a 'can't miss' diagnosis in this age group, though less likely with a normal CRP.\n\ndifferential_diagnosis = [\"Optic Neuritis (associated with MS, NMOSD, or MOGAD)\", \"Non-Arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION)\", \"Compressive Optic Neuropathy (e.g., Optic Nerve Sheath Meningioma)\", \"Giant Cell Arteritis\", \"Infectious Optic Neuropathy (Syphilis, Lyme)\", \"Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy\", \"Toxic/Nutritional Optic Neuropathy\"]"
