    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** Urgent admission to stroke or neurology unit with frequent neurological observations\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Risk of rapid deterioration from cerebellar swelling and brainstem compression Need for close monitoring of level of consciousness, vital signs, and new brainstem signs Facilitates rapid access to imaging and specialist input\n\n*   **Treatment:** Non-contrast CT brain followed immediately by MRI brain and vascular imaging\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Differentiate between ischaemic infarct, haemorrhage, tumour, or demyelination Imaging results are essential to determine suitability for antithrombotic therapy or neurosurgical intervention\n\n*   **Treatment:** Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin (or clopidogrel if aspirin-intolerant) for suspected cerebellar infarction once haemorrhage is excluded\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Reduces risk of early recurrent ischaemic stroke Standard secondary prevention after non-cardioembolic ischaemic stroke\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-intensity statin therapy\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Indicated for secondary prevention after ischaemic stroke or TIA Reduces long-term vascular risk irrespective of baseline cholesterol in this context\n\n*   **Treatment:** Blood pressure optimisation according to acute stroke guidelines\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Avoids exacerbation of cerebral oedema or haemorrhagic transformation Reduces risk of recurrent stroke and other vascular events\n\n*   **Treatment:** Neurosurgical consultation for possible posterior fossa decompression or external ventricular drain if mass effect or hydrocephalus is demonstrated\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Cerebellar infarcts or haemorrhages can cause life-threatening compression of the brainstem Early neurosurgical involvement improves outcomes if decompression becomes necessary\n\n*   **Treatment:** Intravenous thrombolysis or endovascular thrombectomy (if within appropriate time windows and imaging confirms eligible posterior circulation occlusion)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Potential to restore perfusion and limit infarct size Time-sensitive therapy where earlier treatment is associated with better outcomes\n\n*   **Treatment:** Physiotherapy and occupational therapy focusing on gait and balance rehabilitation\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Improves functional recovery from cerebellar ataxia Reduces falls risk and promotes safe mobility\n\n*   **Treatment:** Speech and language therapy assessment if dysarthria or swallowing difficulty develops\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Currently no documented bulbar dysfunction but risk may evolve with lesion progression Implement when symptoms are present or identified on screening\n\n*   **Treatment:** Disease-specific therapy if alternative aetiology confirmed (e.g., corticosteroids for demyelinating lesion, chemotherapy/radiotherapy or surgical resection for tumour, immunotherapy for paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, alcohol cessation and thiamine for alcohol-related degeneration)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Requires definitive diagnosis from imaging, CSF, and serological investigations Therapy must be tailored to the confirmed underlying pathology\n\n*   **Treatment:** Long-term secondary prevention including smoking cessation support, diabetes control, and antihypertensive therapy\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Implemented after acute phase once diagnosis and vascular risk profile are fully characterised Targets modifiable risk factors to prevent recurrent cerebrovascular events\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"Urgent admission to stroke or neurology unit with frequent neurological observations\", \"timing\": \"Start Now\",
