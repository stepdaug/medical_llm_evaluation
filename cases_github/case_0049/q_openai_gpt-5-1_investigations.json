    "response": "MRI of brain and whole spine with contrast is required urgently to confirm optic nerve and cord involvement, define lesion characteristics, and exclude structural compression. CSF analysis and evoked potentials help support a demyelinating diagnosis and demonstrate dissemination in space. Blood tests are needed to rule out metabolic, infectious, and autoimmune mimics and to test for specific antibodies (AQP4, MOG) that alter long-term treatment choices.\n\ninvestigations = [\"MRI of brain and whole spinal cord with gadolinium contrast\", \"Dedicated MRI orbits with fat suppression and gadolinium\", \"Lumbar puncture with CSF cell count, protein, glucose, oligoclonal bands and IgG index\", \"Visual evoked potentials\", \"Optical coherence tomography of retinal nerve fibre layer\", \"Automated visual field testing\", \"Somatosensory evoked potentials of lower limbs\", \"Full blood count\", \"Urea and electrolytes\", \"Liver function tests\", \"C-reactive protein\", \"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate\", \"Blood glucose\", \"Vitamin B12 level\", \"Serum folate level\", \"Thyroid function tests\", \"Serum aquaporin-4 IgG antibody\", \"Serum MOG IgG antibody\", \"Antinuclear antibody\", \"Extractable nuclear antigen panel\", \"Double-stranded DNA antibody\", \"Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies\", \"HIV serology\", \"Syphilis serology (VDRL/TPHA)\", \"Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme level\", \"Serum copper level\", \"Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation\", \"Screening for hepatitis B and C\", \"Chest X-ray\", \"Urinalysis\"]"
