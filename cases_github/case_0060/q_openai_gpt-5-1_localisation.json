    "response": "Gait ataxia with left lower-limb dysmetria, left-sided dysdiadochokinesia and gaze-evoked left horizontal nystagmus, with preserved strength and a negative Romberg test, localises to the left cerebellar hemisphere. Symmetric distal impairment of vibration and joint position sense with preserved power and near-normal reflexes indicates a length-dependent large-fibre peripheral polyneuropathy. Complete visual loss in the left eye with a left relative afferent pupillary defect and normal ocular motility localises to a pre-chiasmal lesion of the left optic nerve.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"left cerebellar hemisphere\", \"bilateral length-dependent peripheral polyneuropathy\", \"left optic nerve\"]"
