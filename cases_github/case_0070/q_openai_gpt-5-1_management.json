    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\u20135 days\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Presentation is highly suggestive of an acute inflammatory demyelinating attack with significant gait and speech impairment Therapeutic window for maximal benefit of steroids is within the first 2 weeks of symptom onset No clinical evidence of systemic infection or sepsis on initial assessment Standard first-line treatment for acute MS, NMOSD and MOGAD relapses while awaiting MRI and serology\n\n*   **Treatment:** Oral prednisolone taper over 1\u20132 weeks following IV methylprednisolone\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Initiated after completion of IV pulse to reduce risk of rebound symptoms Allows gradual withdrawal of corticosteroids and minimises adrenal suppression\n\n*   **Treatment:** Proton pump inhibitor prophylaxis during corticosteroid therapy\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** High-dose steroids increase risk of peptic ulcer disease and gastrointestinal bleeding Patient has no contraindication to PPI and will be receiving several days of systemic steroids\n\n*   **Treatment:** Thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin and graduated compression stockings while inpatient\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Ataxic gait and reduced mobility increase risk of venous thromboembolism High-dose steroids may further increase thrombotic risk\n\n*   **Treatment:** Physiotherapy and occupational therapy focusing on gait, balance and home safety assessment\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Cerebellar ataxia and unstable tandem gait confer high falls risk Early rehabilitation improves functional outcomes and independence\n\n*   **Treatment:** Speech and language therapy assessment and intervention\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Slurred speech suggests cerebellar dysarthria which may impair intelligibility Early assessment can guide communication strategies and screen for associated swallowing problems\n\n*   **Treatment:** Initiation of disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis (e.g. ocrelizumab, natalizumab, fingolimod or other agent according to local protocol)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Requires confirmation of MS diagnosis with MRI and CSF findings and exclusion of NMOSD/MOGAD Choice of agent depends on disease activity, comorbidities, pregnancy plans and JCV serostatus Not required emergently during the acute relapse treatment phase\n\n*   **Treatment:** Long-term immunosuppressive therapy for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder or MOG-antibody disease (e.g. rituximab, inebilizumab, satralizumab, mycophenolate mofetil)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Only indicated if aquaporin-4 or MOG antibodies confirm alternative diagnosis to MS Requires detailed counselling about infection risk, vaccination status and fertility considerations\n\n*   **Treatment:** Plasma exchange for severe or steroid-refractory relapse\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Reserved for cases with poor response to high-dose corticosteroids or very severe visual or cerebellar deficits Invasive procedure requiring central venous access and haemodynamic monitoring, so used selectively\n\n*   **Treatment:** Vitamin D supplementation if deficiency confirmed\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Low vitamin D is associated with increased MS risk and disease activity Dosing should be tailored to measured serum vitamin D level to avoid toxicity\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\\u20135 days\", \"timing\": \"Start Now\", \"reasons\": [\"Presentation is highly suggestive of
