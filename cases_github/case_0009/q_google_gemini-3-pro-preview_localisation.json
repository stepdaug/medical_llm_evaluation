    "response": "The patient presents with reduced visual acuity and a Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect (RAPD) in the left eye, indicative of a left optic neuropathy. The motor examination reveals bilateral, patchy upper limb weakness (involving C5, C6, C7, and T1 myotomes) and asymmetric hyperreflexia (brisk left triceps and knee), with downgoing plantars. This combination of upper motor neuron signs and segmental weakness is best explained by a lesion within the cervical spinal cord. The clinical picture of optic nerve and spinal cord involvement signifies a multifocal CNS process.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Left Optic Nerve\", \"Cervical Spinal Cord\"]"
