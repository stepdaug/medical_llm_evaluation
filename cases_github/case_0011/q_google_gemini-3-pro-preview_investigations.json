    "response": "Urgent neuroimaging is required to confirm the anatomical localisation and characteristic appearance of demyelinating lesions (e.g., Dawson's fingers, enhancing lesions). A comprehensive blood and CSF panel is necessary to differentiate between MS, NMOSD (AQP4 antibodies), and MOGAD, as well as to exclude mimics like infection or systemic vasculitis. This distinction is crucial for long-term disease-modifying therapy selection.\n\ninvestigations = [\"MRI Brain and Spinal Cord with contrast\", \"Full blood count\", \"Urea and electrolytes\", \"Liver function tests\", \"C-reactive protein\", \"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate\", \"Serum Aquaporin-4 antibodies\", \"Serum MOG antibodies\", \"Autoimmune screen (ANA, ANCA, dsDNA)\", \"Vitamin B12 and Folate\", \"HIV serology\", \"Syphilis serology\", \"Lumbar Puncture (CSF for oligoclonal bands, protein, cell count, culture)\", \"Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)\", \"Visual Evoked Potentials\"]"
