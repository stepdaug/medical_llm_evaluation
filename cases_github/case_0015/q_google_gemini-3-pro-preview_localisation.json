    "response": "The patient presents with two distinct clinical syndromes indicating multifocal involvement of the central nervous system (dissemination in space). 1) Right-sided visual acuity loss with a Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect (RAPD) localises to the right optic nerve. 2) The motor and sensory findings in the lower limbs are classic for Brown-S\u00e9quard syndrome (hemicord lesion). Specifically, there is ipsilateral (left) upper motor neuron weakness (spasticity, hyperreflexia, upgoing plantar) and dorsal column loss (impaired vibration/proprioception), with contralateral (right) spinothalamic loss (impaired pinprick). As the upper limbs are largely spared (only minor non-localising reflex asymmetry) and the legs are severely affected, the lesion is in the thoracic cord.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Right Optic Nerve\", \"Left Thoracic Spinal Cord\"]"
