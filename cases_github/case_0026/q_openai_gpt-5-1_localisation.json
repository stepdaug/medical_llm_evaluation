    "response": "A young woman with subacute right-hand sensory loss and distal weakness in selected hand muscles plus left foot drop from weakness of ankle dorsiflexion/eversion, with preserved reflexes, normal plantar responses, normal coordination, and no cranial or long-tract signs. The findings are asymmetric, patchy, and restricted to individual peripheral nerve territories rather than dermatomal or length-dependent, consistent with a multifocal peripheral neuropathy (mononeuritis multiplex) affecting peripheral nerves in both upper and lower limbs.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"bilateral peripheral nerves (mononeuritis multiplex pattern)\"]"
