    "response": "The diagnostic strategy is focused on confirming the suspected multifocal central nervous system demyelination, establishing a definitive diagnosis (primarily differentiating between Multiple Sclerosis and its mimics), and ruling out other potential causes.\n\nThe highest priority investigation is an MRI, which is essential to visualize the lesions in the brain, optic nerve, and spinal cord. This will confirm the clinical localization and look for other asymptomatic lesions, which would provide evidence of dissemination in space, a key criterion for diagnosing MS. Gadolinium contrast is crucial to identify active inflammation, which can help establish dissemination in time.\n\nThe next priority is serological and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis to differentiate between the main demyelinating diseases. Blood tests for Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) and Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein (MOG) antibodies are mandatory to rule out NMOSD and MOGAD, respectively, as their treatment differs significantly from MS. A lumbar puncture to test for CSF-specific oligoclonal bands and an elevated IgG index provides strong supportive evidence for MS.\n\nA broader panel of blood tests is necessary to exclude systemic inflammatory, infectious, and metabolic conditions that can mimic this presentation. Finally, visual evoked potentials can provide objective electrophysiological evidence of demyelination in the optic nerve pathway, confirming the clinical suspicion of optic neuritis.\n\ninvestigations = [\"MRI of brain, orbits, and full spinal cord with gadolinium contrast\", \"Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody serology\", \"Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein (MOG) antibody serology\", \"Lumbar puncture for CSF analysis (including cell count, protein, glucose, oligoclonal bands, and IgG index)\", \"Serum for oligoclonal bands (for comparison with CSF)\", \"Visual Evoked Potentials\", \"Full blood count\", \"Urea and electrolytes\", \"Liver function tests\", \"Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)\", \"Antinuclear Antibody (ANA)\", \"Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE)\", \"Vitamin B12\", \"Syphilis serology\", \"HIV serology\"]",
