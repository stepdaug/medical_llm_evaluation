    "response": "The clinical presentation is characterized by two distinct neurological syndromes in a young woman, developing subacutely: a left optic neuritis (reduced visual acuity, RAPD) and a right-sided partial Brown-S\u00e9quard syndrome at the C5-C6 cervical spinal cord level (ipsilateral motor weakness with mixed UMN/LMN signs, ipsilateral loss of proprioception/vibration, and sensory ataxia). This evidence of multiple lesions separated in space (optic nerve, spinal cord) is the hallmark of a central nervous system inflammatory demyelinating disease.\n\n1.  **Multiple Sclerosis (MS):** This is the most likely diagnosis. The patient's age and sex fit the classic demographic for MS. The combination of optic neuritis and a partial transverse myelitis is a textbook presentation. This presentation represents dissemination in space, and the subacute onset is typical for a clinical attack.\n\n2.  **Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD):** This is a critical differential as it specifically targets the optic nerves and spinal cord. While the patient's presentation fits the core criteria, NMOSD-related optic neuritis and myelitis are often more severe and functionally devastating than what is described here. Serological testing for Aquaporin-4 antibodies (AQP4-IgG) is essential to differentiate it from MS.\n\n3.  **MOG Antibody-Associated Disease (MOGAD):** This is another important inflammatory demyelinating disorder that can present with optic neuritis and transverse myelitis. Like NMOSD, the clinical features overlap significantly with MS, but there can be subtle differences in presentation and imaging. Diagnosis relies on testing for MOG-IgG antibodies.\n\n4.  **Neurosarcoidosis:** This systemic inflammatory disease can mimic MS by causing multifocal inflammatory lesions anywhere in the nervous system, including the optic nerves and spinal cord. It is less common, and the absence of systemic symptoms (e.g., cough, rash, uveitis) makes it less likely, but it remains a diagnostic consideration in cases of multifocal CNS inflammation.\n\ndifferential_diagnosis = [\"Multiple Sclerosis\", \"Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder\", \"MOG Antibody-Associated Disease\", \"Neurosarcoidosis\"]",
