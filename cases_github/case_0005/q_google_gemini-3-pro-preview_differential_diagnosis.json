    "response": "The clinical picture of optic neuritis and acute cerebellar ataxia in a young female is highly suggestive of an inflammatory demyelinating disorder. Multiple Sclerosis is the most likely cause given the dissemination in space. Neuromyelitis Optica (NMOSD) and MOG-antibody disease are key differentials for optic neuritis with central involvement. Other inflammatory or granulomatous conditions like sarcoidosis or vasculitis are less common but possible.\n\ndifferential_diagnosis = [\"Multiple Sclerosis (Relapsing-Remitting)\", \"Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD)\", \"MOG Antibody Associated Disease (MOGAD)\", \"Neurosarcoidosis\", \"Behcet's Disease\", \"Systemic Lupus Erythematosus\", \"Primary CNS Vasculitis\"]"
