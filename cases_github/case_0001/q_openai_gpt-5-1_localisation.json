    "response": "Subacute right arm and leg weakness with hypotonia and reduced biceps/supinator reflexes in the right upper limb but spasticity, hyperreflexia, ankle clonus and an extensor plantar response in the right leg localise to a right cervical cord lesion at the C5-C6 level involving anterior horn cells at that segment and descending tracts below. Sensory abnormalities with impaired joint position and vibration and a positive Romberg indicate dorsal column involvement, while normal limb coordination and cranial nerve motor function argue against a cerebellar or brainstem lesion. A separate left optic neuropathy is indicated by reduced visual acuity and a left relative afferent pupillary defect with otherwise intact ocular motility. This pattern requires at least two anatomically distinct lesions.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"right C5-C6 cervical spinal cord\", \"left optic nerve\"]"
