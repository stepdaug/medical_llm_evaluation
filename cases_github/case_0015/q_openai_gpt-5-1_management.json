    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** No\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** Admission under neurology with close neurological observations and fall-prevention measures\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Brainstem lesions can deteriorate with respiratory or bulbar compromise and require in-hospital monitoring Marked gait ataxia and limb incoordination place the patient at high risk of falls Facilitates rapid completion of MRI and further investigations\n\n*   **Treatment:** Physiotherapy and occupational therapy for gait and limb ataxia\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Improves mobility and balance in the presence of right-sided cerebellar signs and spasticity Reduces fall risk and helps with adaptive strategies for activities of daily living\n\n*   **Treatment:** Mechanical venous thromboembolism prophylaxis (graduated compression stockings or intermittent pneumatic compression)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Reduced mobility from weakness and ataxia increases risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism Mechanical prophylaxis is safe before intracranial imaging has excluded haemorrhage\n\n*   **Treatment:** Pharmacologic venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Chemical prophylaxis should await brain imaging to exclude intracranial haemorrhage or large mass with high bleeding risk Dose and choice may need adjustment for renal function and any planned lumbar puncture\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (e.g., 1 g daily for 3\u20135 days)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Indicated if MRI and CSF support an acute demyelinating plaque causing the deficits Steroids should be delayed until infections and alternative diagnoses such as tumour are reasonably excluded Requires counselling about side effects and gastric and thromboembolism prophylaxis\n\n*   **Treatment:** Initiation of disease-modifying therapy for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Requires formal diagnosis of multiple sclerosis using McDonald criteria including MRI and CSF findings Choice of agent depends on disease activity, comorbidities, pregnancy plans, and patient preference Needs baseline laboratory screening and vaccination review before starting immunotherapy\n\n*   **Treatment:** Microsurgical resection or stereotactic radiotherapy of cerebellopontine angle tumour\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Only indicated if imaging demonstrates an operable cerebellopontine angle mass correlating with symptoms Requires multidisciplinary discussion with neurosurgery, neuro-otology, and oncology Pre-operative audiology and counselling about facial nerve and hearing risks are essential\n\n*   **Treatment:** Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and high-intensity statin\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Should be initiated if imaging confirms a non-cardioembolic pontine infarct and excludes haemorrhage Provides secondary prevention of further ischaemic events Timing must consider planned lumbar puncture or potential need for neurosurgical intervention\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"Admission under neurology with close neurological observations and
