    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\u20135 days\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Disabling cerebellar ataxia likely represents an acute inflammatory demyelinating relapse Early corticosteroids shorten duration and severity of relapse No clinical evidence of raised intracranial pressure or active systemic infection beyond a treatable urinary source\n\n*   **Treatment:** Proton pump inhibitor for gastric protection during steroid therapy\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Reduces risk of steroid-induced gastritis or peptic ulcer disease Standard co-prescription with high-dose corticosteroids in adults\n\n*   **Treatment:** Physiotherapy and occupational therapy focused on gait, balance and falls prevention\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Ataxic gait and left limb incoordination increase fall risk Early rehabilitation improves functional outcome and compensatory strategies\n\n*   **Treatment:** Empirical oral antibiotics for urinary tract infection pending culture results\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Urine nitrites are positive, consistent with bacterial urinary tract infection Intercurrent infections can exacerbate neurological symptoms in demyelinating disease Treating infection is necessary before or alongside high-dose immunosuppression\n\n*   **Treatment:** Initiation of long-term disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis (agent selected based on risk profile and MRI findings)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Requires confirmation that diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis are fulfilled Choice of agent depends on lesion burden, relapse history, comorbidities and patient preference Baseline safety blood tests, infection screening and vaccination review are needed before starting therapy\n\n*   **Treatment:** Long-term immunosuppressive therapy for NMOSD or MOG antibody-associated disease (e.g., rituximab, mycophenolate, satralizumab) if diagnosed\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Indication depends on confirmation of AQP4 or MOG antibody-associated disease Choice of agent and dosing guided by antibody status, relapse pattern and comorbidities Avoids inappropriate exposure to potent immunosuppression before diagnosis is secure\n\n*   **Treatment:** Neurosurgical evaluation for posterior fossa or cervicomedullary decompression if a compressive lesion (e.g., Chiari I malformation) is identified\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Surgical indication depends on MRI evidence of structural compression and CSF flow obstruction Risk\u2013benefit assessment and detailed imaging review are required before operative planning\n\n*   **Treatment:** Genetic counselling and targeted management for hereditary ataxia or optic neuropathy if confirmed\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Genetic diagnosis must first be established by appropriate testing Allows informed family planning, screening of relatives and tailored supportive management No urgent disease-modifying treatment is available that alters acute presentation\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"High-dose intravenous
