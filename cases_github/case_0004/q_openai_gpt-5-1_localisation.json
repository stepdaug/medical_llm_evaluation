    "response": "Bilateral spastic weakness with brisk reflexes and extensor plantar responses in all limbs indicates a bilateral upper motor neuron lesion at or above the cervical cord. Right Horner's syndrome, right palatal and tongue weakness, and gaze-evoked nystagmus localise to the right lower brainstem, while ipsilateral limb dysmetria points to involvement of right cerebellar connections. Bilateral impairment of vibration and joint position sense with relatively preserved pinprick suggests dorsal column/medial lemniscus involvement at the same level. The most parsimonious single site that explains bilateral long-tract signs plus ipsilateral lower-cranial-nerve and cerebellar features is a lesion at the right cervicomedullary junction compressing the medulla and upper cervical cord.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"right cervicomedullary junction\"]"
