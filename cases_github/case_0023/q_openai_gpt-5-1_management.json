    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisolone taper\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Acute right optic neuropathy with RAPD suggests ongoing inflammatory or ischaemic injury where early high-dose steroids can preserve vision and hasten recovery Age over 50 with markedly elevated CRP is highly suspicious for giant cell arteritis, for which immediate systemic steroids are standard of care to prevent bilateral blindness High-dose corticosteroids are also appropriate first-line therapy for an acute demyelinating relapse affecting optic nerve and cerebellum\n\n*   **Treatment:** Urgent admission under neurology with ophthalmology and rheumatology (if vasculitis suspected) co-management\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Facilitates rapid MRI, vascular imaging, temporal artery studies, and lumbar puncture which are time-critical for diagnosis Allows close monitoring of visual acuity and neurological status with capacity to escalate treatment (e.g., plasma exchange) if deterioration occurs\n\n*   **Treatment:** Proton pump inhibitor for gastroprotection during corticosteroid therapy\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** High-dose systemic steroids increase risk of peptic ulcer disease and gastrointestinal bleeding The patient is middle-aged and may require a prolonged steroid course if vasculitis or chronic demyelinating disease is confirmed\n\n*   **Treatment:** Bone protection with calcium, vitamin D, and consideration of bisphosphonate therapy\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** The patient already has osteopenia and will likely receive prolonged corticosteroids or other immunosuppression Bone-protective therapy should be instituted once the need for long-term steroids is confirmed and baseline bone density is documented\n\n*   **Treatment:** Antiplatelet therapy (e.g., aspirin 75\u2013100 mg daily) if cerebellar lesion is confirmed to be ischaemic stroke\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Antiplatelet therapy reduces risk of recurrent ischaemic events after cerebellar infarction due to vasculitis or atherosclerosis Starting antiplatelets before confirming an infarct may expose the patient to unnecessary bleeding risk, so treatment should await neuroimaging clarification\n\n*   **Treatment:** Initiation of long-term disease-modifying immunotherapy tailored to final diagnosis\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Choice of agent differs markedly between multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, and giant cell arteritis or other vasculitides Requires confirmed diagnosis, baseline infection and malignancy screening, vaccination review, and detailed counselling about risks and benefits\n\n*   **Treatment:** Physiotherapy and occupational therapy focusing on left upper-limb ataxia and visual adaptation\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Left upper-limb dysmetria may impair fine motor tasks and activities of daily living even if gait is preserved Rehabilitation planning is best initiated once acute disease activity is stabilised and imaging-defined lesion burden is available\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"High-dose intravenous
