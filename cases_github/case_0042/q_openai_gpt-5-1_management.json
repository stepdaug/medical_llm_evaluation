    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** Urgent hospital admission with spinal precautions (log-rolling and avoidance of spinal flexion or heavy lifting)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Progressive upper motor neuron signs in the left leg indicate active spinal cord dysfunction Immobilisation reduces risk of further mechanical cord compromise before imaging and definitive treatment\n\n*   **Treatment:** Urgent neurosurgical or spinal surgery consultation for possible decompression\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Subacute cord symptoms with back pain raise strong concern for compressive myelopathy Early assessment allows rapid decompression if a surgically treatable lesion is confirmed, improving neurological outcome\n\n*   **Treatment:** Analgesia with paracetamol, NSAIDs if not contraindicated, and short-course opioids if required\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Patient reports significant lower back pain Adequate pain control is necessary for comfort and safe examination while awaiting investigations\n\n*   **Treatment:** Thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin and graduated compression stockings unless contraindicated\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Lower-limb weakness and reduced mobility increase venous thromboembolism risk Early prophylaxis reduces risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism\n\n*   **Treatment:** Bladder and bowel management with post-void residual checks and laxatives as needed\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Spinal cord lesions frequently cause occult sphincter dysfunction even before symptoms are reported Preventing urinary retention and constipation reduces complications such as infection and autonomic dysreflexia\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (e.g., 1 g daily for 3\u20135 days)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Steroids are first-line for inflammatory or demyelinating myelitis but should generally be started after MRI excludes compressive surgical lesions Premature steroids may obscure diagnosis of some tumours or infections and do not replace decompressive surgery if compression is present\n\n*   **Treatment:** Empirical intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Reserved for situations where MRI or labs suggest spinal epidural abscess or systemic infection Unnecessary antibiotics risk adverse effects and may complicate microbiological diagnosis\n\n*   **Treatment:** Definitive decompressive spinal surgery or radiotherapy according to underlying pathology\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Choice and timing of decompression depend on MRI findings and neurosurgical assessment Requires informed consent and perioperative optimisation once diagnosis and level are defined\n\n*   **Treatment:** Initiation of disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis or neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder if confirmed\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Long-term immunomodulatory treatment requires secure diagnosis based on MRI, CSF and antibody studies Agent selection must be individualised and typically follows acute management\n\n*   **Treatment:** Physiotherapy and multidisciplinary neurorehabilitation including gait training and spasticity management\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Rehabilitation should begin once the acute cause has been treated and the neurological deficit is stable Aims to maximise functional recovery, prevent contractures and reduce long-term disability\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"Urgent hospital admission with spinal precautions (log-rolling and avoidance of spinal flexion or heavy lifting)\", \"timing\": \"Start Now\",
