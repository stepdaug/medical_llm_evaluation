    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3-5 days\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Subacute disabling cervical myelitis and optic neuritis strongly suggest an inflammatory demyelinating relapse Early corticosteroids hasten neurological recovery and may reduce permanent cord damage To be administered promptly after urgent MRI has excluded compressive or abscess-related cord pathology\n\n*   **Treatment:** Proton pump inhibitor during steroid therapy\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** High-dose corticosteroids increase the risk of gastritis and peptic ulcer disease Gastroprotection reduces the likelihood of gastrointestinal bleeding in a young patient who may otherwise have few risk factors\n\n*   **Treatment:** Physiotherapy and occupational therapy for gait and right upper limb rehabilitation\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Right-sided weakness and unsteady gait increase the risk of falls and functional decline Early multidisciplinary rehabilitation improves mobility, strength, and independence\n\n*   **Treatment:** Thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin and mechanical measures while mobility is reduced\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Acute neurological impairment and likely reduced ambulation increase venous thromboembolism risk Prophylaxis is standard of care during inpatient management of significant motor deficits\n\n*   **Treatment:** Oral prednisolone taper for 1-2 weeks following IV methylprednisolone\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Started after completion of high-dose IV steroid course Helps prevent rebound symptoms and allows gradual withdrawal of corticosteroids\n\n*   **Treatment:** Initiation of long-term disease-modifying therapy tailored to final diagnosis (e.g., high-efficacy multiple sclerosis agent or rituximab for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Requires confirmation of multiple sclerosis versus NMOSD or MOGAD with MRI, CSF and antibody testing Selection of agent needs infection screening, vaccination review, and shared decision-making around risks and benefits\n\n*   **Treatment:** Therapeutic plasma exchange\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Reserved for severe relapse or inadequate clinical response to high-dose intravenous steroids Particularly important if aquaporin-4 antibody positive or if MRI shows longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis\n\n*   **Treatment:** Vitamin D supplementation and lifestyle counselling (including smoking cessation and exercise advice)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Low vitamin D and smoking are modifiable risk factors associated with higher inflammatory demyelinating disease activity Implemented once acute neurological deficits have stabilised and baseline laboratory values are available\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3-5 days\", \"timing\":
