    "response": "The clinical presentation of lesions separated in space (optic nerve and cerebellum) strongly suggests an inflammatory demyelinating disorder like Multiple Sclerosis. However, the significantly elevated CRP (154) is a major red flag that requires broadening the differential to include systemic infectious (e.g., septic emboli from endocarditis) and granulomatous diseases (e.g., sarcoidosis). Comorbid diverticular disease raises the possibility of a concurrent abdominal infection triggering or mimicking a neurological event.\n\ndifferential_diagnosis = [\"Multiple Sclerosis\", \"Infective Endocarditis with Septic Emboli\", \"Neurosarcoidosis\", \"Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD)\", \"CNS Vasculitis\", \"Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM)\", \"Paraneoplastic Neurological Syndrome\"]"
