    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (e.g., 1 g IV daily for 3 days)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Severe unilateral visual impairment (6/60) consistent with acute optic neuritis of approximately two weeks' duration High-dose IV corticosteroids accelerate visual recovery in demyelinating optic neuritis No clinical evidence of raised intracranial pressure or systemic infection on current assessment\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose oral prednisolone taper following IV methylprednisolone\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Commence immediately after completing IV pulses rather than before Short taper mitigates rebound symptoms while limiting duration of systemic steroid exposure\n\n*   **Treatment:** Proton pump inhibitor for gastric protection during steroid therapy\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** High-dose corticosteroids increase risk of gastrointestinal irritation and ulceration Patient has vascular comorbidities and may later require antiplatelet agents, further raising GI risk\n\n*   **Treatment:** Counselling on driving, work, and eye protection with early referral to low-vision and occupational therapy services if deficits persist\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Monocular visual loss can impair driving and occupational safety Early education and support reduce accident risk and facilitate adaptation\n\n*   **Treatment:** Initiation of multiple sclerosis disease-modifying therapy if MRI and CSF fulfil diagnostic criteria for MS\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Requires confirmation of dissemination in space and time on MRI and/or CSF oligoclonal bands Choice and timing of agent depend on disease activity, prognostic markers, and patient factors\n\n*   **Treatment:** Initiation of long-term immunosuppressive therapy for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder if AQP4-IgG positive\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** NMOSD diagnosis must first be established serologically and radiologically Agents such as rituximab, inebilizumab, or satralizumab require pre-treatment infection screening and vaccination planning\n\n*   **Treatment:** Antiplatelet therapy and intensive vascular risk factor modification if an ischemic optic neuropathy or retinal vascular occlusion is confirmed\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Ischemic aetiology is not established in this relatively young patient Therapy should be targeted based on ophthalmic, vascular, and systemic investigations\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (e.g., 1 g IV daily for 3 days)\", \"timing\": \"Start
