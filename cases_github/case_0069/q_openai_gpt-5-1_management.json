    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** Spinal cord protection measures (bed rest with log-rolling, temporary cervical immobilisation, avoidance of neck flexion and extension)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Clinical signs indicate a cervical myelopathy that could worsen with mechanical instability These measures are low-risk and protect the cord until MRI defines the lesion and spinal stability\n\n*   **Treatment:** Thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin and graduated compression stockings\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Right hemiparesis and unsteady gait increase venous thromboembolism risk No evidence of active bleeding or major contraindication to pharmacological prophylaxis\n\n*   **Treatment:** Bladder, bowel, and pressure-area nursing care (including regular turning and assessment for urinary retention)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Spinal cord lesions predispose to urinary retention, constipation, and pressure ulcers Early supportive care prevents secondary complications and hospital-acquired morbidity\n\n*   **Treatment:** Early physiotherapy and occupational therapy input\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Right-sided weakness and gait disturbance require rehabilitation planning from admission Passive and bed-based exercises can start immediately, progressing once spinal stability is confirmed\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\u20135 days\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Appropriate for suspected inflammatory or demyelinating cervical myelitis (e.g., MS relapse) Should be commenced after MRI excludes significant compressive lesions and infection screen is reviewed given raised inflammatory markers\n\n*   **Treatment:** Urgent surgical decompression of the cervical spinal cord if MRI demonstrates a compressive mass lesion\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Definitive therapy for malignant, disc-related, or other mechanical cord compression Timing and approach depend on MRI findings and neurosurgical assessment but should follow rapidly once compression is identified\n\n*   **Treatment:** Targeted intravenous antibiotics (e.g., vancomycin plus a third-generation cephalosporin) if epidural abscess or bacterial infection is confirmed\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Recent cough and elevated CRP raise the possibility of an infectious aetiology Choice of regimen and duration should be guided by culture results and imaging rather than given empirically in a clinically stable patient without sepsis\n\n*   **Treatment:** Initiation of disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis or other chronic demyelinating disease as indicated\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Long-term immunomodulation is indicated if investigations confirm MS or a related demyelinating disorder Started only after complete diagnostic work-up and risk\u2013benefit discussion with the patient\n\n*   **Treatment:** Oral antispasticity agents (e.g., baclofen) if persistent disabling spasticity develops\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Current priority is acute cord management and defining the underlying diagnosis Spasticity medications are tailored later based on residual deficits and functional needs\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"Spinal cord protection measures (bed rest with log-rolling,
