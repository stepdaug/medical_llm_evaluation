    "response": "The clinical presentation is characterized by multiple neurological deficits affecting various parts of the central nervous system, indicating a multifocal process. A single anatomical lesion cannot account for this widespread symptomatology. The key localizing findings include:\n1.  **Left Optic Neuritis:** Evidenced by decreased visual acuity and a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) in the left eye, which localizes to the left optic nerve.\n2.  **Left Internuclear Ophthalmoplegia (INO):** The combination of left eye adduction failure with nystagmus in the abducting right eye is pathognomonic for a lesion in the left Medial Longitudinal Fasciculus (MLF), located in the dorsal pons.\n3.  **Right Cerebellar Syndrome:** Ipsilateral right-sided dysdiadochokinesia, along with gait ataxia and nystagmus, points to a lesion in the right cerebellar hemisphere or its pathways.\n4.  **Crossed Brainstem Syndromes:** The right palate weakness (deviates left) localizes to the right medulla (involving CN X nucleus/fascicles), while the left tongue weakness (deviates right) localizes to the left medulla (involving CN XII nucleus/fascicles). This confirms bilateral brainstem involvement.\n5.  **Pyramidal and Sensory Tract Lesions:** The right-sided weakness and sensory loss affecting all modalities point to a lesion in the contralateral (left) cerebral hemisphere. The bilateral upper motor neuron signs (spasticity, hyperreflexia, clonus, and Babinski signs) and sensory impairment in the left leg suggest an additional lesion in the cervical spinal cord.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Left Optic Nerve\", \"Left Pontine Tegmentum\", \"Right Cerebellar Hemisphere\", \"Left Cerebral Hemisphere White Matter\", \"Right Medulla\", \"Left Medulla\", \"Bilateral Cervical Spinal Cord\"]",
