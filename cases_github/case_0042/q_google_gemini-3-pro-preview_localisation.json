    "response": "The clinical presentation demonstrates Brown-S\u00e9quard syndrome (hemicord syndrome). There is ipsilateral (left-sided) upper motor neuron weakness (spasticity, hyperreflexia, upgoing plantar) and ipsilateral loss of dorsal column modalities (vibration/proprioception). Contralaterally (right side), there is loss of spinothalamic modalities (pinprick/temperature) with a sensory level in the thoracic region. Upper limbs are spared, localising the lesion to the thoracic cord.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Left Thoracic Spinal Cord\"]"
