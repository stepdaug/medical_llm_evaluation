    "response": "The exam shows a focal central pyramidal syndrome affecting the right leg, a distal large-fibre sensory neuropathy causing sensory ataxia, and a unilateral optic neuropathy. A treatable myeloneuropathy such as vitamin B12 deficiency can produce combined corticospinal and dorsal column dysfunction, optic neuropathy and a length-dependent neuropathy, so this is prioritised despite the asymmetry of leg weakness. CNS demyelinating disorders (multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder) can also account for optic neuritis and a focal central motor lesion, with a coexisting peripheral neuropathy from nutritional or autoimmune causes. Structural pathology of the left parasagittal frontal region (infarct or meningioma) would explain the right leg UMN signs but not the bilateral distal sensory loss or optic neuropathy, so is less likely as a unifying diagnosis but remains in the differential. Systemic autoimmune, metabolic or infectious conditions can cause combined central and peripheral involvement and are therefore included.\n\ndifferential_diagnosis = [\"Vitamin B12 deficiency with subacute combined degeneration and length-dependent peripheral neuropathy\", \"Multiple sclerosis with right optic neuritis and plaque affecting pathways controlling the right leg\", \"Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder\", \"Copper deficiency myeloneuropathy\", \"Left anterior cerebral artery territory ischaemic stroke\", \"Left parasagittal frontal meningioma\", \"Systemic autoimmune disease with CNS and peripheral nervous system involvement (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, Sj\\u00f6gren syndrome, sarcoidosis)\", \"HIV-associated myeloneuropathy\"]"
