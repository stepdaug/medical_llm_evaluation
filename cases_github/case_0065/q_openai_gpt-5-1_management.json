    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\u20135 days\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Acute, functionally significant myelopathy and optic neuropathy strongly suggest inflammatory demyelination Early high-dose corticosteroids improve speed of recovery and may limit permanent disability in demyelinating relapses To be commenced promptly once emergent MRI has excluded compressive cord lesions and active central nervous system infection\n\n*   **Treatment:** Oral prednisolone taper for 2\u20134 weeks after intravenous steroids\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Started after completion of IV methylprednisolone to prevent rebound of inflammation Dose and duration should be individualised once a firm diagnosis is established and comorbidities reviewed\n\n*   **Treatment:** Neurology-led initiation of disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis if confirmed (e.g., ocrelizumab, natalizumab, or other high-efficacy agent)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Choice of agent depends on MRI lesion load, CSF findings, antibody status, and patient factors Requires counselling, baseline infection screening, and vaccination review before commencement\n\n*   **Treatment:** Therapeutic plasma exchange\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Reserved for severe myelitis or optic neuritis not responding adequately to high-dose corticosteroids Particularly indicated if neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder or MOGAD is confirmed or strongly suspected\n\n*   **Treatment:** Neurosurgical decompression of the cervical spinal cord if MRI shows a surgically amenable compressive lesion\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Decompression is the definitive treatment for extradural compression such as tumour, disc prolapse, or epidural abscess Timing and surgical approach depend entirely on imaging findings and anaesthetic assessment\n\n*   **Treatment:** Physiotherapy and occupational therapy-led neurorehabilitation\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Right-sided weakness and sensory loss place the patient at high risk of falls and deconditioning Early rehabilitation optimises motor recovery, balance, gait, and functional independence\n\n*   **Treatment:** Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin and graduated compression stockings\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Right leg weakness and reduced mobility significantly increase risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism No current evidence of contraindications to pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis\n\n*   **Treatment:** Spasticity management with oral baclofen or tizanidine as required\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Spasticity may become more functionally limiting as the acute phase settles Medications should be titrated cautiously after initial stabilisation to avoid excessive weakness or sedation\n\n*   **Treatment:** Proton pump inhibitor while receiving high-dose corticosteroids\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Reduces risk of steroid-associated gastritis and peptic ulcer disease Patient has a history of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, increasing susceptibility to upper gastrointestinal complications\n\n*   **Treatment:** Bladder and bowel management including monitoring for retention, intermittent catheterisation if required, and a regular bowel regimen\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Cervical spinal cord lesions frequently impair sphincter function, predisposing to urinary retention, urinary tract infection, and constipation Early structured management prevents secondary complications and improves comfort and dignity\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\":
