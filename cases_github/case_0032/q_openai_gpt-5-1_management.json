    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** Hospital admission or urgent neurology assessment with falls precautions\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Ataxic gait and impaired coordination create a high falls risk Allows rapid completion of MRI and other urgent investigations Enables close neurological observation for any deterioration suggesting stroke or expanding posterior fossa lesion\n\n*   **Treatment:** Physiotherapy-led gait and balance rehabilitation\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Improves functional mobility and reduces risk of falls Can begin even before aetiology is definitively known Provides objective baseline assessment of ataxia for future comparison\n\n*   **Treatment:** Occupational therapy assessment and provision of walking aids or home adaptations\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Supports safe performance of activities of daily living Reduces environmental hazards that could lead to injury Facilitates early planning for discharge if admitted\n\n*   **Treatment:** Proton pump inhibitor therapy for gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Directly addresses the presenting complaint of worsening heartburn and acid taste Symptomatic relief improves comfort while neurological work-up proceeds Low risk and does not interfere with neurological investigations\n\n*   **Treatment:** Optimisation of diabetes management and avoidance of cerebellotoxic drugs or alcohol\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** History of diabetic ketoacidosis suggests suboptimal glycaemic control which may worsen neurological recovery Poor metabolic control can confound interpretation of neurological symptoms Avoidance of alcohol and drugs such as phenytoin or lithium prevents exacerbation of cerebellar dysfunction\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone for suspected demyelinating cerebellar lesion\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Should only be started once MRI and CSF findings support an inflammatory or demyelinating process such as multiple sclerosis Steroids can mask or worsen infection and some tumours, so inappropriate empiric use is unsafe Timing can usually wait hours to days after definitive imaging without major loss of efficacy\n\n*   **Treatment:** Gluten-free diet and nutritional supplementation if gluten-related ataxia or deficiencies are confirmed\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Requires confirmation of coeliac disease or specific deficiency before committing to lifelong dietary restriction Laboratory and biopsy results should guide targeted supplementation (e.g., vitamins B1, B12, E) Premature dietary change may complicate interpretation of coeliac investigations\n\n*   **Treatment:** Oncological therapy or immunotherapy for paraneoplastic or anti-GAD autoimmune cerebellar ataxia\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Requires identification of an underlying tumour or specific antibody profile Choice of therapy (tumour resection, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, IVIG, rituximab, or other agents) depends on diagnosis Immunotherapy carries significant risks and should follow specialist multidisciplinary discussion\n\n*   **Treatment:** Neurosurgical consultation for possible posterior fossa decompression or tumour resection if mass lesion is identified\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Indication depends on MRI evidence of a resectable tumour or life-threatening mass effect/hydrocephalus Surgical planning requires detailed imaging and risk assessment There is currently no evidence from examination alone of raised intracranial pressure mandating emergent surgery\n\n*   **Treatment:** Genetic counselling and targeted therapy if a hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia is diagnosed\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Genetic testing results are needed to confirm the specific ataxia subtype Management focuses on counselling, family planning, and supportive care tailored to the confirmed mutation Premature counselling without a clear diagnosis can cause unnecessary anxiety\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"Hospital admission
