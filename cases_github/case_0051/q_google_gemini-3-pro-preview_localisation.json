    "response": "The clinical picture is dominated by a 'crossed' brainstem syndrome. Left-sided cranial nerve palsies (VI and VII) fix the lesion level to the left caudal pons. The contralateral (right-sided) hemiparesis and loss of pain/temperature indicate involvement of the corticospinal and spinothalamic tracts on the left. The ipsilateral (left-sided) loss of vibration and proprioception implies the lesion extends medially across the midline to involve the right medial lemniscus (which carries sensory fibres from the left body) or is due to a concurrent patchy ischemic process in the brainstem.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Left Pons\"]"
