    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** Ankle\u2013foot orthosis for the left foot\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Left ankle dorsiflexion weakness produces a high-stepping gait and marked risk of tripping Immediate bracing can improve gait safety and function while diagnostic workup is ongoing\n\n*   **Treatment:** Physiotherapy for strengthening and gait training\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Early rehabilitation helps maintain muscle bulk and joint range of motion in weak distal muscles Gait training and balance work reduce fall risk and improve functional mobility\n\n*   **Treatment:** Education to avoid external nerve compression at elbows and fibular necks\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Both ulnar and common peroneal nerves are vulnerable to pressure-related injury Behavioural modification can prevent further deterioration regardless of the underlying aetiology\n\n*   **Treatment:** Neuropathic symptom control with agents such as gabapentin or amitriptyline (if dysaesthesia or pain is present)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Sensory neuropathy often causes unpleasant paraesthesia or pain impacting sleep and quality of life Symptomatic treatment can be initiated safely while awaiting diagnostic clarification\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose corticosteroids for suspected vasculitic mononeuritis multiplex\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Current deficits are relatively mild and there is no clear systemic inflammatory syndrome on initial tests Immunosuppression carries significant risks (infection, metabolic complications) and should follow supportive evidence of vasculitis from blood tests, neurophysiology, and possibly biopsy Baseline infection screening and assessment of bone, glucose, and blood pressure status are required before starting high-dose steroids\n\n*   **Treatment:** Second-line immunosuppressive therapy such as cyclophosphamide or rituximab (if systemic vasculitis is confirmed and severe)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Choice and intensity of immunosuppression depend on the specific vasculitic subtype and multisystem involvement These agents require multidisciplinary input, detailed counselling on fertility and infection risks, and prophylactic measures before initiation\n\n*   **Treatment:** Genetic counselling and PMP22 testing if hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies is suspected\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Genetic confirmation is not required for acute safety but is important for long-term prognosis and family planning Testing should be guided by neurophysiology showing a demyelinating, pressure-sensitive neuropathy pattern\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"Ankle\\u2013foot orthosis for the left foot\", \"timing\": \"Start Now\",
