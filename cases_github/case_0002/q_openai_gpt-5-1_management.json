    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** Intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\u20135 days\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Acute multifocal neurological deficits consistent with demyelinating relapse High-dose corticosteroids shorten relapse duration and speed functional recovery No evidence in the provided data of active systemic infection or major steroid contraindication\n\n*   **Treatment:** Oral prednisolone taper following IV methylprednisolone (if local protocol recommends)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Reduces risk of rebound symptoms after high-dose IV steroids Allows gradual withdrawal of corticosteroids\n\n*   **Treatment:** Proton pump inhibitor for gastric protection\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** High-dose systemic steroids increase risk of gastrointestinal irritation and ulceration Young patient otherwise well, so prophylaxis minimises avoidable adverse effects\n\n*   **Treatment:** Physiotherapy with gait and balance rehabilitation\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Right-sided limb ataxia and spastic weakness are causing unsteady, ataxic gait Early rehabilitation reduces falls risk and facilitates neuroplastic recovery\n\n*   **Treatment:** Occupational therapy assessment and home safety review\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Right leg dysfunction may impair transfers and activities of daily living Environmental modifications and assistive devices can reduce injury risk\n\n*   **Treatment:** Thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin and graduated compression stockings unless contraindicated\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Reduced mobility from ataxia and weakness increases venous thromboembolism risk High-dose steroids may further predispose to thrombosis\n\n*   **Treatment:** Symptomatic treatment for spasticity (e.g., oral baclofen) if clinically significant\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Right lower limb spasticity contributes to gait impairment Early control of spasticity improves comfort and function and facilitates physiotherapy\n\n*   **Treatment:** Discuss and initiate long-term disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis (agent chosen according to risk profile and local guidelines)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Requires confirmation of MS diagnosis by MRI and CSF findings and exclusion of mimics Choice between platform and high-efficacy therapies depends on disease activity, comorbidities and pregnancy plans Baseline infection screen and vaccination review should precede immunotherapy\n\n*   **Treatment:** Consider long-term immunosuppressive therapy such as rituximab if neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder or MOGAD is confirmed instead of MS\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Maintenance treatment differs substantially between MS and antibody-mediated demyelinating diseases Therapy must be tailored once aquaporin-4 and MOG antibody results are available\n\n*   **Treatment:** Vitamin D supplementation and general lifestyle optimisation (smoking cessation, exercise)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Low vitamin D and smoking are modifiable risk factors associated with increased inflammatory activity in demyelinating disease Can be instituted after acute management and counselling\n\n*   **Treatment:** Counselling, psychological support and patient education about demyelinating disease and relapse recognition\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** New chronic neurological diagnosis in a young adult has major psychosocial impact Education improves adherence to follow-up and timely presentation with future relapses\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"Intravenous
