    "response": "The clinical presentation demonstrates 'dissemination in space'. 1) Left reduced visual acuity with a Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect (RAPD) localises to the Left Optic Nerve. 2) The 'Left CN III palsy' (severe ptosis, mydriasis, adduction plegia, vertical gaze paresis) combined with contralateral Right hemiparesis represents a Weber's syndrome, localising to the Left Midbrain. 3) Right Horner's syndrome, Right limb ataxia, and Right-sided lower cranial nerve signs (tongue deviates right, palate deviates left implying right vagal weakness) localise to the Right Medulla (Lateral Medullary syndrome features). Bilateral hyperreflexia indicates general upper motor neuron involvement consistent with these brainstem lesions.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Left Optic Nerve\", \"Left Midbrain\", \"Right Medulla\"]"
