    "response": "Right optic neuropathy is suggested by reduced visual acuity and a right RAPD. Unsteady, wide-based gait with negative Romberg, gaze-evoked right nystagmus, and right-sided limb dysmetria indicate a right cerebellar/brainstem process. Concurrent left-leg-predominant spastic weakness with hyperreflexia, ankle clonus, and an extensor plantar response localises to involvement of the right corticospinal tract above the pyramidal decussation, best explained by a right lateral pontine lesion affecting descending motor fibres and cerebellar connections in addition to a separate right optic nerve lesion.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"right optic nerve\", \"right lateral pons\"]"
