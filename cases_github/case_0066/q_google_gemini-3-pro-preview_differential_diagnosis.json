    "response": "The presence of lesions disseminated in space (optic nerve and brainstem) is highly suggestive of an inflammatory demyelinating aetiology. Given the specific involvement of the optic nerve and brainstem, Multiple Sclerosis is the primary differential, followed closely by antibody-mediated disorders like NMOSD and MOGAD. While the patient has vascular risk factors (hyperglycaemia), a single ischaemic event cannot explain both the right optic neuritis and the left midbrain syndrome, making vascular causes less likely unless multifocal. Granulomatous or neoplastic infiltration are important secondary considerations.\n\ndifferential_diagnosis = [\"Multiple Sclerosis\", \"Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD)\", \"MOG Antibody Disease (MOGAD)\", \"Neurosarcoidosis\", \"CNS Lymphoma\", \"Multifocal Ischaemic Stroke\"]"
