    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** Intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\u20135 days\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Clinical picture strongly suggests an acute inflammatory demyelinating relapse affecting brainstem and optic nerve High-dose IV corticosteroids shorten duration and severity of relapses in multiple sclerosis and related demyelinating diseases No current evidence of sepsis or raised intracranial pressure on initial assessment\n\n*   **Treatment:** Oral prednisolone taper over 1\u20132 weeks following IV steroids\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Commence once IV methylprednisolone course is completed Helps prevent rebound deterioration after abrupt cessation of high-dose steroids\n\n*   **Treatment:** Plasma exchange (five to seven exchanges over 10\u201314 days)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Reserved for cases with severe persistent deficit or poor response to IV steroids Particularly indicated if neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder or MOG-antibody disease is confirmed\n\n*   **Treatment:** Initiation or escalation of high-efficacy disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** A further disabling relapse despite existing therapy suggests need for optimisation of long-term treatment Choice of agent depends on MRI lesion burden, prior treatments and screening for infections and contraindications Best started after acute relapse has stabilised and alternative diagnoses have been excluded\n\n*   **Treatment:** Physiotherapy and occupational therapy focused on gait, balance and upper-limb function\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Right hemiparesis, spasticity and ataxia significantly impair mobility and activities of daily living Early rehabilitation reduces risk of falls, deconditioning and contractures and promotes neuroplastic recovery\n\n*   **Treatment:** Oral baclofen (or alternative antispasticity agent) titrated to effect\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Right-sided spasticity with clonus is functionally limiting and painful for many patients Reducing tone improves comfort and facilitates physiotherapy, while monitoring for excessive weakness\n\n*   **Treatment:** Pharmacologic and mechanical venous thromboembolism prophylaxis\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Hemiparesis and reduced mobility markedly increase risk of deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism Low-molecular-weight heparin and compression stockings are standard prophylaxis in immobilised neurological patients unless contraindicated\n\n*   **Treatment:** Neuro-ophthalmology referral for visual rehabilitation and management of diplopia and ptosis\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Detailed assessment and interventions such as prisms, occlusion therapy or surgical correction are best planned once the acute inflammatory phase has stabilised Supports long-term visual function and quality of life if residual third-nerve or optic nerve deficits persist\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"Intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\\u20135 days\", \"timing\": \"Start Now\", \"reasons\":
