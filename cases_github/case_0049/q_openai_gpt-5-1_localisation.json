    "response": "A left relative afferent pupillary defect with profound visual acuity loss and normal ocular motility localises to the left optic nerve. Unilateral pyramidal pattern weakness, spasticity, hyperreflexia with clonus and extensor plantar confined to the left leg, with impaired proprioception/vibration and positive Romberg but preserved upper limbs and cranial motor function, localises best to an ipsilateral hemicord lesion in the thoracic spinal cord involving corticospinal and dorsal column pathways for the left lower limb.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"left optic nerve\", \"left thoracic spinal cord\"]"
