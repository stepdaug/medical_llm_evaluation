    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** Admission to a hyperacute stroke unit with close neurological and cardiorespiratory monitoring\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Brainstem strokes can deteriorate rapidly with respiratory or bulbar compromise Allows rapid implementation of reperfusion therapy, blood pressure and glucose control, and early rehabilitation\n\n*   **Treatment:** Intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase for eligible ischaemic stroke\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Potentially disabling posterior circulation stroke affecting brainstem Should be given if within time window and imaging confirms ischaemic infarct without haemorrhage or major contraindications\n\n*   **Treatment:** Mechanical thrombectomy for proven large vertebrobasilar artery occlusion\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Large-vessel posterior circulation occlusion has high morbidity and mortality Endovascular therapy within appropriate time window improves outcomes when combined with medical management\n\n*   **Treatment:** Aspirin 300 mg orally or via nasogastric tube, then 75 mg daily\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Should be started as soon as intracranial haemorrhage is excluded on imaging if patient is not thrombolysed If intravenous thrombolysis is given, antiplatelet therapy must be delayed for at least 24 hours and until repeat imaging excludes haemorrhagic transformation\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-intensity statin therapy (e.g., atorvastatin 80 mg nightly)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Secondary prevention after presumed ischaemic stroke regardless of baseline cholesterol Reduces risk of recurrent cerebrovascular events\n\n*   **Treatment:** Swallow assessment and aspiration precautions with early speech and language therapy involvement\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Bulbar dysfunction from IX/X involvement increases aspiration risk Determines need for modified diet or enteral feeding to maintain nutrition and prevent pneumonia\n\n*   **Treatment:** Early physiotherapy and occupational therapy for mobilisation and rehabilitation\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Right-sided spastic hemiparesis and left limb ataxia will benefit from early targeted rehabilitation Early mobilisation reduces complications such as venous thromboembolism, deconditioning and contractures\n\n*   **Treatment:** Anticoagulation (e.g., direct oral anticoagulant) if vertebral artery dissection or cardioembolic source is confirmed\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Requires confirmation of underlying aetiology on vascular and cardiac imaging Should only be started once intracranial haemorrhage is excluded and risk\u2013benefit has been assessed\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone followed by oral taper for suspected optic neuritis or inflammatory demyelinating disease\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Steroids may improve visual recovery in demyelinating optic neuritis but are not indicated for ischaemic optic neuropathy Should be considered only after MRI and CSF studies support a demyelinating or inflammatory diagnosis and once acute stroke management is stabilised\n\n*   **Treatment:** Long-term vascular risk factor modification (blood pressure optimisation, diabetes management, smoking cessation, exercise and diet counselling)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Addresses underlying contributors to ischaemic stroke and optic ischaemia Implemented after acute phase once diagnosis and specific aetiology are clarified\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"Admission to a hyperacute stroke unit with close neurological and cardiorespiratory monitoring\", \"timing\":
