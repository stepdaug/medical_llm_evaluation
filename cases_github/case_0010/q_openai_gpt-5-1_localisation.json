    "response": "Right relative afferent pupillary defect with otherwise normal ocular motility localises to a right pre-chiasmal optic nerve lesion. Spasticity, mild weakness, hyperreflexia with ankle clonus and extensor plantar confined to the right lower limb, together with predominant proprioceptive/vibration impairment in the same limb, positive Romberg and otherwise normal coordination, are most parsimoniously explained by a single lesion involving the left parasagittal frontoparietal cortex (leg area) affecting both primary motor and somatosensory representations.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"right optic nerve\", \"left parasagittal frontoparietal cortex (leg area)\"]"
