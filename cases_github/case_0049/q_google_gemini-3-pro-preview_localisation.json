    "response": "The patient presents with two distinct anatomical syndromes. Firstly, severe left monocular visual loss (Hand Movements) combined with a left Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect (RAPD) localises to the left optic nerve. Secondly, the motor and sensory findings constitute a classic Brown-S\u00e9quard syndrome: left-sided upper motor neuron weakness (spasticity, hyperreflexia, clonus, upgoing plantar) and ipsilateral loss of dorsal column sensation (proprioception/vibration), paired with contralateral (right-sided) loss of spinothalamic sensation (pain/temperature) below a thoracic level. This localises to a hemi-cord lesion.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Left Optic Nerve\", \"Left Thoracic Spinal Cord\"]"
