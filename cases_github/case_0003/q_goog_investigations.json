    "response": "The investigation strategy for this patient aims to confirm a central nervous system inflammatory/demyelinating process, establish dissemination in space and time to meet diagnostic criteria for Multiple Sclerosis, and crucially, to exclude important mimics like NMOSD, MOGAD, and neurosarcoidosis. The highest priority is an MRI of the brain and entire spinal cord with contrast to visualise lesions corresponding to the clinical deficits and look for characteristic patterns. A lumbar puncture is equally vital to detect intrathecal inflammation (oligoclonal bands) which strongly supports an MS diagnosis. Specific serum antibody tests for AQP4 and MOG are mandatory to rule out NMOSD and MOGAD, as their treatment and prognosis differ significantly from MS. Further investigations, including neurophysiology and blood tests for systemic mimics, are necessary to complete the diagnostic workup.\n\ninvestigations = [\"MRI of brain and entire spinal cord with and without gadolinium contrast\", \"Lumbar Puncture for CSF analysis\", \"CSF Oligoclonal Bands and IgG Index\", \"Serum Aquaporin-4 Antibody\", \"Serum Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein Antibody\", \"Visual Evoked Potentials\", \"Serum for paired Oligoclonal Band analysis\", \"Full Blood Count\", \"Urea and Electrolytes\", \"Liver Function Tests\", \"Antinuclear Antibody\", \"Angiotensin Converting Enzyme\", \"Syphilis Serology\", \"Vitamin B12 level\", \"CT of the chest\"]",
