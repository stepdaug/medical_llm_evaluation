    "response": "Urgent MRI of the cervical spine is required to confirm the hemicord lesion and identify or exclude compressive pathology, while early respiratory investigations quantify the degree of ventilatory compromise. Baseline blood tests screen for infection, inflammation, and metabolic myelopathies; targeted serology, brain MRI, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis evaluate for demyelinating or autoimmune causes; and neurophysiology is reserved for unresolved questions about respiratory muscle involvement.\n\ninvestigations = [\"MRI of cervical spine with gadolinium contrast\", \"Arterial blood gas\", \"Supine and sitting forced vital capacity and negative inspiratory force\", \"Chest X-ray\", \"MRI of brain\", \"CT scan of cervical spine (with CT myelography if MRI is contraindicated)\", \"Full blood count\", \"Urea and electrolytes\", \"Liver function tests\", \"C-reactive protein\", \"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate\", \"Coagulation screen\", \"Blood glucose\", \"Vitamin B12 level\", \"Serum copper and ceruloplasmin\", \"HIV serology\", \"Syphilis serology (VDRL/TPPA)\", \"Antinuclear antibody and extractable nuclear antigen panel\", \"Aquaporin-4 antibody\", \"Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody\", \"Lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid analysis including cell count, protein, glucose, oligoclonal bands, cultures, and cytology (after exclusion of compressive lesion on imaging)\", \"Nerve conduction studies and electromyography including phrenic nerve conduction (if respiratory weakness is not fully explained by MRI findings)\", \"Electrocardiogram\"]"
