    "response": "The patient presents with a classic 'crossed' brainstem syndrome. The combination of left-sided cranial nerve palsies (IX, X, XII) and left-sided Horner's syndrome, with right-sided hemiparesis (spasticity, weakness, hyperreflexia) and right-sided loss of vibration/proprioception, indicates involvement of both medial and lateral structures in the left medulla. Specifically, the spinal trigeminal nucleus (left facial sensory loss), spinothalamic tract (right body pain/temp loss), nucleus ambiguus (palatal weakness), hypoglossal nucleus (tongue deviation), corticospinal tract (right hemiparesis), and medial lemniscus (right dorsal column loss). This complex is best explained by a single lesion in the Left Medulla Oblongata (Hemimedullary syndrome). Furthermore, the reduced visual acuity and Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect (RAPD) in the left eye cannot be explained by the brainstem lesion and indicate a separate, concurrent lesion in the Left Optic Nerve. The presence of lesions separated in space and time suggests a multifocal inflammatory etiology.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Left Medulla Oblongata\", \"Left Optic Nerve\"]"
