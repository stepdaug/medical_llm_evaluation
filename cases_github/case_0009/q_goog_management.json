    "response": "1.  **Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n2.  **Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n    *   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous corticosteroids (e.g., Methylprednisolone 1g daily for 3-5 days)\n    *   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n    *   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** The patient is experiencing an acute, functionally significant neurological event (optic neuritis). High-dose corticosteroids are the standard of care to reduce the duration and severity of the acute inflammation, thereby accelerating the speed of recovery. Initiating this treatment promptly is crucial to maximise the benefit for their vision.\n\n    *   **Treatment:** High-efficacy Disease-Modifying Therapy (DMT) for Multiple Sclerosis\n    *   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n    *   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** While the clinical presentation is highly suggestive of Multiple Sclerosis, a definitive diagnosis requires confirmation with investigations, particularly MRI. It is essential to first rule out key mimics such as Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) and MOG Antibody Disease (MOGAD), as some MS DMTs can be ineffective or even harmful in these conditions. Treatment should be delayed until diagnostic results are available and a comprehensive discussion about the risks, benefits, and monitoring of different DMT options has occurred with the patient.\n\n    *   **Treatment:** Referral to a multidisciplinary team (including MS specialist nurse, physiotherapy, and occupational therapy) for symptomatic support and education.\n    *   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n    *   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** A new diagnosis of a significant neurological condition is a life-altering event. Early engagement provides crucial education about the condition, offers psychological support, and establishes a plan for managing potential symptoms like fatigue or mood changes. This holistic support is essential from the time of initial presentation and should not be delayed.\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"High-dose intravenous corticosteroids\", \"timing\": \"Start Now\", \"reasons\": [\"To accelerate recovery from the acute optic neuritis.\", \"To reduce the duration and severity of the active CNS inflammation causing current symptoms.\"]}, {\"treatment\": \"High-efficacy Disease-Modifying Therapy\", \"timing\": \"Delay\", \"reasons\": [\"To await definitive diagnostic confirmation from MRI and serological testing.\", \"To rule out critical mimics like NMOSD and MOGAD, for which some MS treatments are contraindicated.\", \"To allow for comprehensive patient counselling on the risks, benefits, and choice of long-term therapy.\"]}, {\"treatment\": \"Referral to multidisciplinary team\", \"timing\": \"Start Now\", \"reasons\": [\"To provide immediate patient education and psychosocial support following a new, significant diagnosis.\", \"To proactively manage potential non-motor symptoms such as fatigue and mood changes.\", \"To establish a long-term support network for holistic care.\"]}]",
