    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** Admit to neurology ward for monitoring and multidisciplinary assessment\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Brainstem involvement with gait instability carries a risk of sudden deterioration and falls Allows rapid completion of MRI, lumbar puncture, and other investigations Facilitates early initiation of disease-specific and supportive therapies\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\u20135 days\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Subacute disabling brainstem syndrome is highly suggestive of an inflammatory demyelinating relapse Corticosteroids hasten recovery and may limit long-term neurological deficit Symptom onset within the usual treatment window for acute demyelinating attacks\n\n*   **Treatment:** Physiotherapy and occupational therapy focused on right-sided weakness and balance\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Early rehabilitation improves functional recovery in hemiparesis Reduces risk of contractures, deconditioning, and falls Optimises gait and activities of daily living while medical treatment takes effect\n\n*   **Treatment:** Thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin and mechanical measures\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Reduced mobility from right hemiparesis increases venous thromboembolism risk No current evidence of contraindication such as active bleeding Standard preventive measure during acute neurological admissions\n\n*   **Treatment:** Symptomatic management of diplopia or oscillopsia (e.g., temporary eye patching or prisms)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Internuclear ophthalmoplegia and nystagmus can cause disabling visual symptoms Simple non-pharmacological measures can immediately improve comfort and function\n\n*   **Treatment:** Initiation of disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Requires confirmation of multiple sclerosis diagnosis by MRI and CSF findings Choice of agent depends on risk stratification, infection screen, and pregnancy plans Better started electively after counselling and shared decision-making\n\n*   **Treatment:** Oral levothyroxine replacement if hypothyroidism is confirmed\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Cold intolerance and dry skin suggest hypothyroidism but diagnosis requires thyroid function tests Thyroid hormone replacement is important but not emergent compared with acute brainstem pathology Dose selection should be based on biochemistry and clinical status\n\n*   **Treatment:** Plasma exchange\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Reserved for severe demyelinating attacks that respond poorly to high-dose corticosteroids Invasive therapy with risks, so only justified if there is inadequate clinical improvement after 1\u20132 weeks\n\n*   **Treatment:** Pharmacological management of spasticity (e.g., oral baclofen)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Spasticity is present but currently mild and may improve with acute treatment and physiotherapy Premature use of antispastic agents could worsen functional weakness Best introduced after reassessment of tone and mobility in follow-up\n\n*   **Treatment:** Psychological support and referral to a multiple sclerosis nurse specialist\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** A new diagnosis of a chronic neurological disease is psychologically challenging Supportive counselling and education are most effective once diagnosis is confirmed Assists with long-term adherence to disease-modifying therapy and lifestyle modifications\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"Admit to neurology ward for monitoring and multidisciplinary assessment\",
