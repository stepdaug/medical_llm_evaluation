    "response": "The primary goal of the investigation is to confirm the presence of multifocal CNS inflammation, assess for evidence of dissemination in time, and exclude important mimics of multiple sclerosis (MS), for which this presentation is highly suggestive. The highest priority is neuroimaging to visualize the lesions and specific serological tests to rule out other key inflammatory demyelinating disorders like NMOSD and MOGAD, as their treatments differ significantly. A lumbar puncture is also critical to detect intrathecal inflammation, a hallmark of MS. A broader screen for systemic inflammatory, infectious, and metabolic conditions is necessary to exclude other potential causes of this multifocal neurological syndrome.\n\ninvestigations = [\"MRI of brain and spinal cord with gadolinium contrast\", \"Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody test\", \"Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein (MOG) antibody test\", \"Lumbar puncture for CSF analysis (including oligoclonal bands, IgG index, cell count, and protein)\", \"Full blood count\", \"Urea and electrolytes\", \"Liver function tests\", \"Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)\", \"C-reactive Protein (CRP)\", \"Vitamin B12 level\", \"Antinuclear Antibodies (ANA)\", \"Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) level\", \"Syphilis serology\", \"HIV serology\", \"Visual Evoked Potentials (VEPs)\", \"Chest X-ray\"]",
