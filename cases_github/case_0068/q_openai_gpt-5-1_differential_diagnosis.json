    "response": "Multifocal CNS involvement of optic nerve, brainstem and cervical cord in a 27-year-old with subacute evolution is most consistent with an inflammatory demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis; NMOSD and MOGAD are key alternatives when optic neuritis and myelitis coexist. Granulomatous, vasculitic and neoplastic processes can mimic this pattern and must be excluded. A posterior communicating artery aneurysm can explain the pupil-involving third nerve palsy but not the wider cord and optic features, yet is critical to rule out.\n\ndifferential_diagnosis = [\"Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis\", \"Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (AQP4-IgG associated)\", \"Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD)\", \"Inflammatory CNS vasculitis (primary or secondary to systemic autoimmune disease)\", \"Neurosarcoidosis\", \"Brainstem and cervical spinal cord intrinsic neoplasm (e.g., low-grade glioma)\", \"Right posterior communicating artery aneurysm causing compressive third nerve palsy\"]"
