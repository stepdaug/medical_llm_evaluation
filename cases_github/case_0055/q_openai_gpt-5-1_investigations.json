    "response": "Urgent neuroimaging is required to differentiate vascular from mass and demyelinating lesions, as this directs acute management and prognostication. Vascular imaging assesses for posterior circulation occlusion and treatable large-vessel disease. Baseline blood tests look for metabolic precipitants, coagulation status, and systemic malignancy or autoimmune disease. Further targeted tests and CSF analysis help evaluate for demyelinating, infectious, or paraneoplastic aetiologies if imaging is non-diagnostic or suggests inflammation.\n\ninvestigations = [\"MRI of brain with diffusion-weighted imaging and contrast\", \"MR angiogram or CT angiogram of head and neck\", \"Non-contrast CT brain\", \"Full blood count\", \"Urea and electrolytes\", \"Liver function tests\", \"Coagulation screen\", \"Blood glucose\", \"Lipid profile\", \"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate\", \"C-reactive protein\", \"Vitamin B12 level\", \"Thiamine level\", \"Thyroid function tests\", \"Serum alcohol level (if clinically indicated)\", \"Autoimmune screen including antinuclear antibody and extractable nuclear antigens\", \"Serum paraneoplastic antibody panel\", \"Serum onconeural antibodies (e.g., anti-Yo, anti-Hu, anti-Ri, anti-Tr, others per local panel)\", \"Serum tumour markers (e.g., PSA, CEA, CA-19-9, CA-125 as guided by history)\", \"Chest CT scan\", \"CT scan of abdomen and pelvis\", \"Lumbar puncture with CSF cell count, protein, glucose, oligoclonal bands, and cytology (if no contraindication on imaging)\", \"Electrocardiogram\", \"Transthoracic echocardiogram\", \"Holter monitor or prolonged cardiac rhythm monitoring (if embolic stroke suspected)\", \"Toxicology screen (if toxin exposure suspected)\"]"
