    "response": "Bilateral spasticity with brisk reflexes and extensor plantars indicates bilateral corticospinal involvement. Primary position torsional nystagmus, bilateral intention tremor/dysmetria, severe bilateral ptosis with complex ophthalmoplegia and dilated pupils localise to the midbrain tegmentum affecting oculomotor nuclei/fascicles and cerebellar outflow while also involving cerebral peduncles. Distal symmetric loss of vibration/JPS/pinprick suggests a concurrent length\u2011dependent peripheral neuropathy.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"bilateral midbrain tegmentum\", \"bilateral length-dependent peripheral polyneuropathy\"]"
