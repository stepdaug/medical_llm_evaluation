Firstly, the Right Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect (RAPD) and severe reduction in visual acuity (Counting Fingers) localise to the Right Optic Nerve. Secondly, the constellation of a Right CN III palsy (ptosis, mydriasis, ophthalmoplegia) combined with contralateral (Left) spastic hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, and cerebellar signs (intention tremor, dysmetria) represents a crossed brainstem syndrome (overlap of Weber's and Benedikt's syndromes). This localises to the Right Midbrain (specifically affecting the cerebral peduncle, tegmentum, and CN III fascicles).\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Right Optic Nerve\", \"Right Midbrain\"]"
