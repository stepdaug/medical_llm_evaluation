    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** Airway, breathing and circulation optimisation with admission to a hyperacute stroke or high-dependency unit\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Bulbar dysfunction from IX/X/XII involvement increases risk of aspiration and airway compromise Brainstem strokes can deteriorate rapidly, requiring close neurological and cardiorespiratory monitoring Optimising haemodynamics helps maintain cerebral perfusion\n\n*   **Treatment:** Nil by mouth until formal swallow assessment, then appropriate texture-modified oral intake or nasogastric feeding\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Palatal and tongue weakness imply high aspiration risk with oral intake Early swallow assessment and safe nutrition reduce pneumonia and malnutrition risk\n\n*   **Treatment:** Intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase or tenecteplase according to local stroke protocol\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Suspected disabling posterior circulation ischaemic stroke Should be given as soon as brain imaging excludes intracranial haemorrhage and if the patient is within the approved time window with no contraindications\n\n*   **Treatment:** Endovascular mechanical thrombectomy of vertebral or basilar artery occlusion if present\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Posterior circulation large-vessel occlusion carries high morbidity and mortality Thrombectomy improves outcomes in selected patients up to 6\u201324 hours from onset depending on imaging and clinical criteria\n\n*   **Treatment:** Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin (300 mg loading followed by 75 mg daily or equivalent regimen)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** If thrombolysis is given, antiplatelets should be withheld for 24 hours to limit haemorrhagic complications Antiplatelet therapy is started after follow-up imaging confirms absence of intracranial haemorrhage or haemorrhagic transformation\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-intensity statin therapy (e.g., atorvastatin 80 mg nightly)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Indicated for secondary prevention once an ischaemic mechanism is confirmed Usually started within the first 24\u201348 hours after checking liver function and when swallowing or enteral access is established\n\n*   **Treatment:** Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with intermittent pneumatic compression and, if haemorrhage is excluded, low-dose low-molecular-weight heparin\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Right-sided weakness and reduced mobility increase risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism Early mechanical and pharmacological prophylaxis reduces preventable thromboembolic complications\n\n*   **Treatment:** Early multidisciplinary neurorehabilitation including physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and speech and language therapy\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Hemiparesis, ataxia and bulbar dysfunction will benefit from task-specific rehabilitation to maximise recovery Speech and language therapy is essential for communication strategies and ongoing swallow management\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone followed by an oral taper if a demyelinating or inflammatory brainstem lesion is diagnosed\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Immunosuppressive therapy should be reserved for confirmed demyelinating or inflammatory pathology Empirical steroids before diagnosis could mask infection and complicate stroke management\n\n*   **Treatment:** Neurosurgical or radiosurgical intervention for brainstem tumour or cavernous malformation if identified\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Definitive management depends on imaging confirmation of a resectable or targetable lesion Requires multidisciplinary discussion to balance potential benefit against high procedural risk in the brainstem\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"Airway, breathing and circulation optimisation with
