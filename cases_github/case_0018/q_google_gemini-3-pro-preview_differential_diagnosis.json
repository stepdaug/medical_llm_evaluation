    "response": "In a 39-year-old patient, acute/subacute unilateral optic nerve dysfunction is most commonly caused by inflammatory demyelination (Optic Neuritis), which is highly suggestive of Multiple Sclerosis or Clinically Isolated Syndrome. In a male patient, Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy is an important differential. Atypical inflammatory causes (NMO, MOG) and compressive lesions must also be considered.\n\ndifferential_diagnosis = [\"Optic Neuritis (associated with Multiple Sclerosis)\", \"Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS)\", \"Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)\", \"Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD)\", \"MOG-Antibody Associated Disease\", \"Compressive Optic Neuropathy (e.g., Optic Nerve Sheath Meningioma)\", \"Infectious Optic Neuropathy (e.g., Syphilis, Lyme disease)\"]"
