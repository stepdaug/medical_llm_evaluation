    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** No\u2014there\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** Foot care education and ulcer prevention (daily inspection, appropriate footwear)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Distal sensory loss increases risk of unnoticed injuries and ulcers Low risk, high benefit\n\n*   **Treatment:** Physiotherapy and balance/strength training\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Areflexia and distal weakness increase fall risk Improves function while investigations proceed\n\n*   **Treatment:** Compression stockings and leg elevation for dependent oedema\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Symptomatic relief for presenting complaint No cardiopulmonary contraindications evident\n\n*   **Treatment:** Safety\u2011netting and monitoring for progression (urgent admission if rapidly worsening weakness, dyspnoea, dysphagia, or autonomic symptoms)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Early detection of possible immune neuropathy with respiratory/bulbar compromise Prevents delayed escalation if deterioration occurs\n\n*   **Treatment:** Vitamin B12 replacement (e.g., IM hydroxocobalamin)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Start after laboratory confirmation of deficiency Avoid masking other causes and allow baseline comparison\n\n*   **Treatment:** Levothyroxine for hypothyroidism\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Only indicated if TSH/FT4 abnormal Targets a reversible cause of neuropathy\n\n*   **Treatment:** Glycaemic optimisation (diet, metformin/other agents per diabetes status)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Institute after confirmation of diabetes or prediabetes Glycaemic control slows neuropathy progression\n\n*   **Treatment:** Neuropathic pain agents (duloxetine, gabapentin, or amitriptyline as tolerated)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Initiate only if painful symptoms are present Tailor choice to comorbidities and side\u2011effect profile\n\n*   **Treatment:** Hematology-directed therapy if paraproteinemia/amyloidosis identified\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Requires confirmation by electrophoresis/immunofixation and staging Disease-specific management improves neuropathy\n\n*   **Treatment:** Immunotherapy for CIDP (IVIG, corticosteroids, or plasma exchange)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Only if NCS/CSF support demyelinating immune neuropathy Avoids unnecessary immunosuppression in axonal/metabolic causes\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"Foot care education and ulcer prevention (daily inspection, appropriate footwear)\", \"timing\": \"Start
