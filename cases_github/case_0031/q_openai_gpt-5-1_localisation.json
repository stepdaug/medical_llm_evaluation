    "response": "Right-sided spastic weakness with hyperreflexia and extensor plantar response indicates an upper motor neuron lesion rostral to the pyramidal decussation on the left. Concurrent ipsilateral (left) lower cranial nerve IX/X and XII palsies (palate deviating right, tongue deviating left), left Horner syndrome (mild ptosis, miosis), left limb ataxia with gaze-evoked nystagmus, and hemibody sensory dissociation all point to a single lesion involving both medial and lateral structures of the left medulla (a hemimedullary brainstem lesion). The unilateral reduction in visual acuity with a left RAPD localises separately to a left optic nerve lesion anterior to the chiasm, which cannot be explained by the medullary lesion.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"left medulla\", \"left optic nerve\"]"
