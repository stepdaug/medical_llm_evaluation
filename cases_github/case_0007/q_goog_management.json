    "response": "**1. Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**2. Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-Dose Intravenous Methylprednisolone\n    *   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n    *   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** The patient is presenting with a severe, disabling acute inflammatory attack on the central nervous system. Immediate administration of high-dose corticosteroids is the first-line standard of care to rapidly suppress inflammation, reduce blood-brain barrier disruption, and limit permanent neurological damage. This intervention is crucial to maximize the chances of functional recovery from her visual loss, weakness, and ataxia.\n\n*   **Treatment:** Multidisciplinary Neurorehabilitation (Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy)\n    *   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n    *   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Early rehabilitation is essential to address the significant functional deficits (hemiparesis, ataxia) and prevent secondary complications such as contractures, deconditioning, and falls. Initiating therapy concurrently with medical treatment will optimize functional outcomes and patient safety.\n\n*   **Treatment:** Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) Prophylaxis\n    *   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n    *   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** The patient's right-sided weakness impairs her mobility, placing her at high risk for developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Prophylactic measures (e.g., low-molecular-weight heparin) are indicated immediately to prevent these potentially life-threatening complications.\n\n*   **Treatment:** Gastroprotection (e.g., Proton Pump Inhibitor)\n    *   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n    *   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** This should be started concurrently with high-dose corticosteroids. Steroids are known to cause gastric irritation and increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding. Prophylactic gastroprotection is standard practice to mitigate this significant side effect.\n\n*   **Treatment:** Plasma Exchange (PLEX)\n    *   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n    *   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** PLEX is a second-line therapy for severe inflammatory demyelinating attacks. Its use is reserved for patients who show a poor or inadequate response to the initial course of high-dose corticosteroids. A decision to proceed will be made after assessing the clinical trajectory following the completion of the steroid course.\n\n*   **Treatment:** Long-Term Disease-Modifying Therapy (DMT)\n    *   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n    *   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** The immediate focus is on treating the acute relapse. The selection of a long-term DMT to prevent future attacks is critically dependent on establishing a definitive diagnosis (e.g., MS, NMOSD, MOGAD), as treatment strategies differ significantly and some MS therapies can worsen NMOSD. This decision must await the results of key investigations, including MRI, CSF analysis, and specific antibody testing.\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"High-Dose Intravenous Methylprednisolone\", \"timing\": \"Start Now\", \"reasons\": [\"To rapidly suppress acute CNS inflammation\", \"To limit permanent neurological damage and maximize functional recovery\"]}, {\"treatment\": \"Multidisciplinary Neurorehabilitation\", \"timing\": \"Start Now\", \"reasons\": [\"To address functional deficits from weakness and ataxia\", \"To prevent secondary complications of immobility\"]}, {\"treatment\": \"Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) Prophylaxis\", \"timing\": \"Start Now\", \"reasons\": [\"To prevent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism due to reduced mobility\"]}, {\"treatment\": \"Gastroprotection\", \"timing\": \"Start Now\", \"reasons\": [\"To mitigate the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding from high-dose corticosteroid therapy\"]}, {\"treatment\": \"Plasma Exchange (PLEX)\", \"timing\": \"Delay\", \"reasons\": [\"Reserved as a second-line therapy for severe attacks with inadequate response to corticosteroids\"]}, {\"treatment\": \"Long-Term Disease-Modifying Therapy (DMT)\", \"timing\": \"Delay\", \"reasons\": [\"Selection requires a definitive diagnosis from pending investigations\", \"Premature initiation could be ineffective or harmful depending on the underlying disease\"]}]",
