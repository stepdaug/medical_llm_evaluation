    "response": "Urgent MRI of the brainstem, brain, cervical cord and orbits is needed to confirm localisation, differentiate demyelination from infarct, haemorrhage or tumour, and guide acute therapy. CSF studies, visual evoked potentials and serum antibody testing help confirm multiple sclerosis or neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, while routine blood tests, autoimmune and infectious screens exclude important mimics. Vascular imaging and basic cardiac work-up are required if imaging suggests ischaemia, and chest imaging is appropriate in view of cough and to screen for sarcoidosis or infection.\n\ninvestigations = [\"MRI of brain, brainstem, cervical spinal cord and orbits with gadolinium\", \"MR angiography of intracranial and extracranial vessels\", \"Lumbar puncture with CSF cell count, protein, glucose and oligoclonal bands\", \"Visual evoked potentials\", \"Full blood count\", \"Urea and electrolytes\", \"Liver function tests\", \"C-reactive protein\", \"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate\", \"Blood glucose\", \"Serum vitamin B12\", \"Serum folate\", \"Thyroid function tests\", \"Serum copper and ceruloplasmin\", \"Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme level\", \"Serum aquaporin-4 IgG antibody\", \"Serum myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody\", \"HIV serology\", \"Syphilis serology\", \"Antinuclear antibody\", \"Extractable nuclear antigen panel\", \"Double-stranded DNA antibody\", \"Antiphospholipid antibody panel\", \"Chest X-ray\", \"ECG\", \"Transthoracic echocardiogram\"]"
