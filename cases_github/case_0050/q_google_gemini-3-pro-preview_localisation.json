These are distinct hallmarks of an optic neuropathy. While there are subtle motor findings (4+/5 left wrist extension and right ankle dorsiflexion), these are non-localising to a single pathway and may represent early multifocal demyelination or be effort-dependent; the definitive and clinically dominant lesion is in the anterior visual pathway.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Left Optic Nerve\"]"
