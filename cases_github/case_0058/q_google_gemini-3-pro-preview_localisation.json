    "response": "The clinical picture presents distinct deficits indicative of multifocal CNS involvement 'disseminated in space'. 1) Right visual acuity reduction and RAPD indicates a lesion of the Right Optic Nerve. 2) Right-sided Lower Motor Neuron facial weakness (CN VII) combined with Right lateral rectus paresis (CN VI) localises to the Right Pons (facial colliculus/tegmentum). The co-occurrence of contralateral (Left-sided) spastic hemiparesis and hemisensory loss confirms a Right Pontine lesion affecting the corticospinal tract and medial lemniscus/spinothalamic tracts (a crossed brainstem syndrome consistent with Millard-Gubler or Foville syndrome). The Left limb ataxia is likely part of an ataxic hemiparesis syndrome arising from the pontine lesion involving pontocerebellar fibers.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Right Optic Nerve\", \"Right Pons\"]"
