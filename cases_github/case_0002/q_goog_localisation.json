    "response": "This young woman's examination reveals multiple neurological deficits that cannot be explained by a single lesion, indicating a multifocal process disseminated in space within the central nervous system, characteristic of a disease like multiple sclerosis. My reasoning for localizing the distinct lesions is as follows:\n\n1.  **Left Optic Neuropathy:** The combination of reduced visual acuity (6/12) and a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) in the left eye is a clear sign of dysfunction in the afferent visual pathway anterior to the optic chiasm. This localizes definitively to the **Left Optic Nerve**.\n2.  **Right-Sided Cerebellar Dysfunction:** The presence of ipsilateral limb ataxia (dysmetria on finger-nose and heel-shin, and dysdiadochokinesia), a broad-based ataxic gait with tandem instability, and gaze-evoked nystagmus are all hallmark features of a cerebellar lesion. As cerebellar signs are typically ipsilateral to the lesion, these findings localize to the **Right Cerebellar Hemisphere**.\n3.  **Left Cerebral Hemisphere Lesion:** The patient exhibits upper motor neuron (UMN) signs isolated to the right leg, including weakness, spasticity, brisk reflexes with clonus, and an upgoing plantar response (Babinski sign). There is also accompanying sensory loss of all modalities in the same distribution. This pattern points to a lesion in the contralateral motor and sensory pathways. The selective involvement of the leg suggests a lesion affecting the specific cortical representation for the lower limb, which is located medially in the **Left Paracentral Lobule** or the immediate subcortical white matter.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Left Optic Nerve\", \"Right Cerebellar Hemisphere\", \"Left Paracentral Lobule\"]",
