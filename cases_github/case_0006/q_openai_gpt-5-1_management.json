    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\u20135 days\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Findings suggest an acute inflammatory demyelinating relapse affecting the brainstem and possibly optic nerve High-dose corticosteroids shorten relapse duration and accelerate neurological recovery in demyelinating disease Vital signs and inflammatory markers are stable, reducing concern for uncontrolled systemic infection\n\n*   **Treatment:** Oral proton pump inhibitor while receiving high-dose corticosteroids\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** High-dose steroids increase risk of gastritis and peptic ulcer disease Gastroprotection reduces steroid-related upper gastrointestinal complications\n\n*   **Treatment:** Physiotherapy and occupational therapy focusing on balance, gait training, and falls prevention\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Patient has unsteady gait and impaired tandem walking with right limb ataxia, placing her at high risk of falls Early multidisciplinary rehabilitation improves functional outcomes and compensatory strategies in cerebellar and pyramidal syndromes\n\n*   **Treatment:** Thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin and mechanical measures if mobility is significantly reduced\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Spastic left leg and cerebellar ataxia may limit mobility during the acute phase Reduced mobility in hospital increases the risk of venous thromboembolism\n\n*   **Treatment:** Initiation of long-term disease-modifying therapy for relapsing multiple sclerosis (agent selected according to disease activity and local protocol)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Definitive diagnosis of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis requires MRI and CSF confirmation and exclusion of mimics such as NMOSD and neurosarcoidosis Choice of disease-modifying therapy depends on disease burden, comorbidities, pregnancy plans, and baseline infection screening (e.g., hepatitis, HIV, JC virus) Starting DMT after completion of the diagnostic workup and initial relapse treatment is standard care\n\n*   **Treatment:** Targeted immunosuppressive therapy if an alternative inflammatory cause such as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder or neurosarcoidosis is confirmed (e.g., rituximab or other steroid-sparing agent)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Specific long-term immunosuppression differs between multiple sclerosis, NMOSD, and neurosarcoidosis and should be tailored to the confirmed diagnosis Some MS treatments can worsen NMOSD, so definitive diagnostic clarification is essential before initiating non-steroid immunotherapy\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\\u20135 days\", \"timing\": \"Start Now\", \"reasons\": [\"Findings suggest an acute
