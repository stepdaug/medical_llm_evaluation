    "response": "1.  **Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n2.  **Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n    *   **Treatment:** High-Dose Intravenous Methylprednisolone\n    *   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n    *   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** The patient is experiencing an acute, multifocal neurological attack with functionally significant deficits (optic neuritis, cerebellar ataxia, and leg weakness). High-dose corticosteroids are the standard of care to reduce the inflammation associated with this acute demyelinating event, shorten the duration of the relapse, and hasten functional recovery.\n    *   **Treatment:** Disease-Modifying Therapy (DMT) for Multiple Sclerosis\n    *   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n    *   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** While starting a long-term DMT is crucial to prevent future relapses and disability progression, it is essential to first confirm the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis with the results of the planned investigations (especially MRI and CSF analysis). This short delay also allows for a thorough discussion with the patient about the various DMT options, their efficacy, risks, and benefits to facilitate shared decision-making for this long-term treatment.\n    *   **Treatment:** Anti-spasticity Medication (e.g., Baclofen)\n    *   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n    *   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** The patient has spasticity in the right lower limb, which is a current and likely uncomfortable symptom. Initiating symptomatic treatment now can improve her comfort, reduce muscle tone, and potentially improve mobility and function while she recovers from the acute relapse.\n    *   **Treatment:** Multidisciplinary Rehabilitation (Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy)\n    *   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n    *   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** The patient has significant gait ataxia, limb ataxia, and weakness. Early engagement with physiotherapy and occupational therapy is critical to maximize functional recovery, improve balance and strength, and develop compensatory strategies to maintain independence and safety.\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"High-Dose Intravenous Methylprednisolone\", \"timing\": \"Start Now\", \"reasons\": [\"The patient is experiencing an acute, disabling neurological relapse.\", \"Corticosteroids are proven to reduce inflammation and speed recovery from acute MS attacks.\"]}, {\"treatment\": \"Disease-Modifying Therapy (DMT) for Multiple Sclerosis\", \"timing\": \"Delay\", \"reasons\": [\"A definitive diagnosis of MS must be confirmed by investigations before starting long-term therapy.\", \"Allows time for shared decision-making with the patient regarding the choice of DMT.\"]}, {\"treatment\": \"Anti-spasticity Medication (e.g., Baclofen)\", \"timing\": \"Start Now\", \"reasons\": [\"Spasticity is a current, symptomatic problem affecting patient comfort and function.\", \"Immediate treatment can provide symptomatic relief.\"]}, {\"treatment\": \"Multidisciplinary Rehabilitation (Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy)\", \"timing\": \"Start Now\", \"reasons\": [\"The patient has significant functional deficits in gait, balance, and coordination.\", \"Early intervention is key to maximizing functional recovery and improving long-term outcomes.\"]}]",
