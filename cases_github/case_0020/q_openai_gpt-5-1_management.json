    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** No\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** Admission under neurology with close neurological observation\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Brainstem lesions can deteriorate rapidly due to oedema or extension Inpatient care allows expedited imaging and multidisciplinary assessment\n\n*   **Treatment:** Physiotherapy and occupational therapy for gait and limb weakness\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Improves mobility and functional independence Reduces risk of falls, deconditioning and contractures in the context of left hemiparesis and ataxia\n\n*   **Treatment:** Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin and mechanical compression\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Hemiparesis and reduced mobility substantially increase deep vein thrombosis risk Prophylactic dosing is standard in non-ambulant neurological patients without known intracranial haemorrhage\n\n*   **Treatment:** Falls precautions and provision of appropriate walking aids\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Unsteady, ataxic gait and unilateral weakness confer high risk of falls and injury Environmental modifications and aids help maintain safety during mobilisation\n\n*   **Treatment:** Speech and swallow assessment with dietary modifications if indicated\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Brainstem pathology can compromise bulbar function even if not yet clinically obvious Early assessment prevents aspiration and ensures adequate nutrition and hydration\n\n*   **Treatment:** Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 300 mg daily then 75 mg daily\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Indicated for secondary prevention if MRI confirms an ischaemic midbrain stroke Should not be started before imaging excludes haemorrhage or haemorrhagic-prone lesions such as cavernoma or tumour\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone for suspected demyelinating lesion\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** First-line treatment for acute brainstem relapse in multiple sclerosis Should only be given once MRI and CSF support a demyelinating aetiology and infection or lymphoma have been excluded\n\n*   **Treatment:** Dexamethasone to treat perilesional cerebral oedema\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Used if imaging reveals an oedematous tumour or metastasis with mass effect or clinical deterioration Steroids can obscure histological diagnosis and should follow neurosurgical or neuro-oncology consultation\n\n*   **Treatment:** Definitive oncological management such as neurosurgical debulking, radiotherapy or chemotherapy\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Requires tissue diagnosis and detailed characterisation of any identified midbrain tumour Choice of modality depends on histology, tumour extent and patient preferences after multidisciplinary discussion\n\n*   **Treatment:** Long-term disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis if confirmed\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Selection of agent depends on confirmed MS subtype, MRI lesion burden and prognostic factors Initiation should follow completion of diagnostic workup and patient counselling\n\n*   **Treatment:** Secondary vascular prevention with high-intensity statin and optimisation of blood pressure and lifestyle\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Indicated if a vascular aetiology such as ischaemic midbrain stroke is diagnosed Therapy should be tailored once vascular risk factors and imaging findings are fully assessed\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"Admission under neurology with close neurological observation\", \"timing\": \"Start Now\", \"reasons\": [\"Brainstem lesions can
