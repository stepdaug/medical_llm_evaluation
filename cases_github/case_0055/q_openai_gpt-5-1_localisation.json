    "response": "The main abnormal findings are right-sided limb incoordination (intention tremor, dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesia), ataxic gait with impaired tandem walking but negative Romberg, and gaze-evoked horizontal nystagmus on right gaze, all without significant weakness, sensory loss, or pyramidal signs. This constellation is best explained by a lesion affecting the right cerebellar hemisphere and its connections, most prominently involving the right cerebellar hemisphere and flocculonodular/paravermian region that coordinates ipsilateral limbs and ocular movements.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"right cerebellar hemisphere\"]"
