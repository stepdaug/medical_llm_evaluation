    "response": "Right-sided spastic hemiparesis with brisk reflexes and an extensor plantar response, in the absence of cranial nerve involvement, localises to the corticospinal tract within the cervical cord. Ipsilateral impairment of vibration and joint position sense with contralateral loss of pinprick sensation below the lesion, plus positive Romberg and sensory ataxic gait, is classic for a Brown-Sequard pattern from a right high cervical hemicord lesion, which can also compromise the ipsilateral phrenic outflow and explain severe breathlessness.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"right high cervical spinal cord hemicord\"]"
