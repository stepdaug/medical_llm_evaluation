    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** Urgent referral to neurosurgery/spinal surgery with concurrent spinal immobilisation\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Clinical evidence of spinal cord compression mandates prompt specialist assessment Early decompression is associated with better neurological recovery Immobilisation limits risk of further cord injury if the spine is unstable\n\n*   **Treatment:** Emergency MRI of the whole spine with gadolinium contrast\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Required to confirm the level and nature of the lesion Guides decisions about urgent decompressive surgery or alternative therapy\n\n*   **Treatment:** Empiric broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics (e.g., vancomycin plus ceftriaxone)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Fever and back pain with myelopathy strongly suggest possible spinal epidural abscess Early antibiotics reduce risk of sepsis and permanent neurological damage Blood cultures can be drawn immediately before the first dose\n\n*   **Treatment:** Surgical decompression of the affected spinal level with abscess drainage or tumour resection as indicated\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Progressive or established neurological deficit from cord compression is an indication for urgent decompression Timely surgery (ideally within 24 hours of deficit) improves functional outcome\n\n*   **Treatment:** Analgesia with paracetamol and short-term opioids as required, avoiding excessive sedation\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Severe back pain is likely and should be controlled Adequate analgesia facilitates examination and mobilisation without masking neurological deterioration\n\n*   **Treatment:** Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis (graduated compression stockings and, when safe, low-molecular-weight heparin)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Neurological deficit and reduced mobility increase risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism Mechanical prophylaxis can start immediately, with pharmacological prophylaxis timed around any surgery\n\n*   **Treatment:** Bladder and bowel care with monitoring for urinary retention and constipation\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Spinal cord lesions may impair autonomic function even before symptoms are obvious Preventing urinary retention and constipation reduces discomfort, infection risk and autonomic complications\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone for confirmed inflammatory demyelinating myelitis\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Steroids can worsen uncontrolled infection and obscure fever Should be started only after MRI and CSF exclude compressive or infectious causes and support an inflammatory demyelinating aetiology\n\n*   **Treatment:** Long-term disease-modifying therapy tailored to the final diagnosis (e.g., disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis, biologics for axial spondyloarthritis, or oncological therapy for tumour)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Choice of chronic therapy depends on definitive aetiological diagnosis Initiated after acute management and multidisciplinary evaluation\n\n*   **Treatment:** Early physiotherapy and multidisciplinary neurorehabilitation\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Started once the spine is stabilised and acute pathology is treated Essential to maximise functional recovery, gait and independence\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"Urgent referral to neurosurgery/spinal
