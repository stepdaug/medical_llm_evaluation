    "response": "The presence of fever (38.1\u00b0C) combined with subacute brainstem signs in a young patient strongly suggests an infectious or inflammatory aetiology. Rhombencephalitis (particularly Listeria or viral) is a top concern. A brainstem abscess (possibly parasitic given the history of Roundworm) or high-grade glioma are important differentials. Demyelinating disorders like ADEM or MS are also possible.\n\ndifferential_diagnosis = [\"Rhombencephalitis (e.g., Listeria monocytogenes, HSV, Enterovirus)\", \"Brainstem Abscess (Bacterial or Parasitic)\", \"Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM)\", \"Brainstem Glioma\", \"Multiple Sclerosis\", \"Vertebral Artery Dissection\"]"
