    "response": "Findings are multifocal: right RAPD with reduced acuity indicates an ipsilateral optic neuropathy; right limb dysmetria with gaze-evoked right nystagmus localises to the right cerebellar hemisphere/peduncle; left leg spasticity with brisk knee, ankle clonus and upgoing plantar plus contralateral (right) pain/temperature loss in body suggests a left thoracic hemicord lesion. Upper limbs are largely spared for pyramidal signs, supporting a thoracic rather than cervical cord level.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"right optic nerve\", \"right cerebellar hemisphere\", \"left thoracic spinal cord\"]"
