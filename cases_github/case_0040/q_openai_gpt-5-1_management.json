    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** Parenteral vitamin B12 replacement (e.g., hydroxocobalamin 1 mg intramuscularly on alternate days initially)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Clinical picture is strongly suggestive of a myeloneuropathy in which vitamin B12 deficiency is a common and readily treatable cause Vitamin B12 injections are safe and should not be delayed while awaiting confirmatory levels, provided blood is drawn for measurement before the first dose Early treatment improves the chance of neurological recovery and limits progression of spinal cord damage\n\n*   **Treatment:** Physiotherapy for gait training, strengthening and spasticity management\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Right leg weakness and spasticity are already impairing mobility and increasing fall risk Early mobilisation and targeted exercises help prevent contractures and secondary deconditioning\n\n*   **Treatment:** Occupational therapy assessment and provision of walking aids and home safety modifications\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Unsteady gait and positive Romberg indicate high risk of falls during activities of daily living Early provision of appropriate aids (e.g., stick, frame) and environmental adaptations can reduce injury risk\n\n*   **Treatment:** Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin and compression stockings, if not contraindicated\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Marked right leg weakness and reduced mobility increase venous thromboembolism risk Prophylaxis is standard of care for neurologically impaired patients with limited ambulation\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone for suspected acute CNS demyelinating lesion\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Should be commenced only after MRI excludes compressive, vascular or infective causes of myelopathy Steroids can mask infection and may worsen certain pathologies, so imaging and basic blood tests are required first\n\n*   **Treatment:** Long-term disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis if diagnostic criteria are fulfilled\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Requires confirmation of multiple sclerosis with clinical and MRI evidence of dissemination in time and space Choice of agent depends on risk stratification, comorbidities and patient preference, which can only be addressed after full workup\n\n*   **Treatment:** Targeted therapy for alternative systemic causes (e.g., copper supplementation, immunosuppression for autoimmune disease, antiretroviral therapy for HIV) based on results\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Specific treatment must be tailored to the confirmed underlying aetiology from investigations Starting these therapies empirically before a diagnosis could expose the patient to unnecessary risk or toxicity\n\n*   **Treatment:** Ophthalmology referral and treatment of optic neuropathy (including consideration of corticosteroids if inflammatory)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Optic nerve involvement is functionally significant but not acutely vision-threatening on the information available Management strategy depends on the cause (demyelinating, ischaemic, nutritional or inflammatory), which requires imaging and laboratory evaluation\n\n*   **Treatment:** Management of neuropathic symptoms with agents such as gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine or amitriptyline if painful dysaesthesias are present\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Length-dependent sensory neuropathy often produces distressing neuropathic pain which impairs sleep and mobility Symptomatic treatment can be initiated empirically and adjusted according to response and side effects\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\":
