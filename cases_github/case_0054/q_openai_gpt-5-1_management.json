    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** Intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\u20135 days followed by a short oral steroid taper\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Acute demyelinating optic neuritis with significant visual impairment and associated cerebellar relapse High-dose steroids accelerate recovery from relapses in multiple sclerosis and related demyelinating disorders No clinical evidence of active infection or contraindications in the presented data\n\n*   **Treatment:** Proton pump inhibitor for gastroprotection during high-dose steroid therapy\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Reduces risk of steroid-induced gastritis or peptic ulcer disease Patient will receive several days of high-dose corticosteroids\n\n*   **Treatment:** Initiation of high-efficacy disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis (e.g., ocrelizumab, natalizumab, or equivalent per local protocols)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Requires confirmation of multiple sclerosis with MRI and CSF studies Baseline infection screening and vaccination review are needed before starting immunosuppressive therapy Choice of agent should follow multidisciplinary discussion and patient counselling about risks and benefits\n\n*   **Treatment:** Physiotherapy, vestibular and cerebellar rehabilitation with gait and balance training\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Patient has ataxic gait and unstable tandem walking, increasing fall risk Early rehabilitation improves adaptation to cerebellar and sensory deficits Can be initiated safely in parallel with diagnostic work-up\n\n*   **Treatment:** Neuropathic pain management and conservative treatment for sciatica (e.g., gabapentin or amitriptyline, NSAIDs as appropriate, and lumbar/core strengthening exercises)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** History of sciatica with objective left L5 weakness suggests symptomatic radiculopathy Early analgesia and targeted physiotherapy may prevent chronic pain and functional decline No immediate indication for surgical intervention is described\n\n*   **Treatment:** Vitamin B12 supplementation if deficiency confirmed\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** B12 deficiency is a reversible cause of myelopathy, optic neuropathy and neuropathy but must be biochemically documented Avoids unnecessary treatment if levels are normal\n\n*   **Treatment:** Neurosurgical or interventional pain referral for possible lumbar decompression or nerve root block\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Reserved for persistent or progressive L5 radiculopathy despite optimal conservative management Requires correlation with MRI lumbar spine findings\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"Intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\\u20135 days followed by a short oral steroid
