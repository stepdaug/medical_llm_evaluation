    "response": "Unilateral spastic weakness of the right lower limb with brisk reflexes and an extensor plantar response indicates an upper motor neuron lesion affecting corticospinal fibres to the right leg. Symmetric impairment/absence of vibration and joint position sense in both lower limbs with preserved pinprick, positive Romberg, unsteady but non-cerebellar gait, and normal cranial nerves and arms all point to involvement of the dorsal columns for lower-limb afferents at a level below the cervical enlargement. A single lesion affecting the dorsal and lateral columns of the thoracic cord, more pronounced on the right, parsimoniously explains these findings.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"bilateral thoracic spinal cord\"]"
