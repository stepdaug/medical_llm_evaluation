    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** Admit to high-dependency or stroke unit with close neurological and cardiorespiratory monitoring\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Brainstem involvement risks sudden deterioration in consciousness, respiration and airway protection Allows frequent neurological observations and rapid response to any worsening\n\n*   **Treatment:** Airway, breathing and circulation optimisation including supplemental oxygen if needed, blood pressure and glucose control, and temperature management\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Physiological optimisation reduces secondary brain injury in acute CNS lesions Posterior circulation strokes and brainstem masses are highly sensitive to alterations in perfusion and oxygenation\n\n*   **Treatment:** Nil by mouth until formal swallowing assessment and institution of aspiration precautions\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Brainstem pathology and left hemiparesis increase risk of dysphagia and silent aspiration Prevents aspiration pneumonia while definitive assessment is arranged\n\n*   **Treatment:** Mechanical venous thromboembolism prophylaxis (e.g. intermittent pneumatic compression) and, once haemorrhage is excluded, pharmacological prophylaxis with low-dose low-molecular-weight heparin if not contraindicated\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Hemiparesis and reduced mobility substantially increase VTE risk Early prophylaxis reduces risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism\n\n*   **Treatment:** Intravenous thrombolysis and/or endovascular thrombectomy as per acute ischaemic stroke protocol if imaging confirms an eligible posterior circulation infarct within treatment window\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Requires prior neuroimaging to confirm ischaemic stroke and exclude haemorrhage or mass Eligibility depends on time of onset, infarct extent, and absence of contraindications\n\n*   **Treatment:** Endovascular coiling or surgical clipping of a posterior communicating or basilar tip aneurysm if demonstrated\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Definitive treatment for compressive aneurysm causing third nerve palsy and brainstem compromise Requires angiographic confirmation and multidisciplinary neurosurgical/neurointerventional planning\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone followed by an oral taper if MRI and CSF support an acute demyelinating relapse (e.g. multiple sclerosis)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Steroids can shorten duration and severity of acute demyelinating attacks Should not be started before excluding infection, mass lesion and vascular causes\n\n*   **Treatment:** Early multidisciplinary rehabilitation (physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Initiated once patient is medically stable to improve motor recovery, gait and coordination Addresses functional deficits from left hemiparesis and cerebellar ataxia and reduces long-term disability\n\n*   **Treatment:** Long-term secondary prevention tailored to final diagnosis (antiplatelet or anticoagulation for stroke, management of vascular risk factors, or disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Reduces risk of recurrence or progression of the underlying disorder Choice of agent depends on whether the final aetiology is vascular, demyelinating or neoplastic\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"Admit to high-dependency or stroke unit with close
