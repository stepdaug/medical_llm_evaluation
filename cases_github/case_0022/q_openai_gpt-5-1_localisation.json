    "response": "Right-sided spastic hemiparesis with brisk reflexes and extensor plantar response plus contralateral hemisensory loss indicate a left-sided central lesion above the decussation of motor and sensory pathways. Concurrent ipsilateral lower motor neuron left facial weakness and left internuclear ophthalmoplegia (left eye adduction paresis with gaze-evoked horizontal nystagmus on right gaze) localise to the left pons. The unilateral reduction in left visual acuity with a left relative afferent pupillary defect requires a separate lesion of the left optic nerve.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"left pons\", \"left optic nerve\"]"
