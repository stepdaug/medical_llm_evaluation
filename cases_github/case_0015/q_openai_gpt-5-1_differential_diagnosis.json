Age, sex, and the combination of cerebellar, brainstem, and long-tract signs without major vascular risk factors make a demyelinating plaque from relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis most likely, but posterior circulation infarct and posterior fossa tumours or intrinsic brainstem neoplasms remain important alternatives.\n\ndifferential_diagnosis = [\"Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis with right pontine plaque\", \"Right lateral pontine infarct (posterior circulation ischaemic stroke)\", \"Right cerebellopontine angle tumour (e.g., vestibular schwannoma or meningioma)\", \"Intrinsic right pontine glioma\", \"Brainstem cavernous malformation with prior haemorrhage\"]"
