    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** Admission to stroke or neurology unit with close neurological observations and early multidisciplinary rehabilitation\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Brainstem lesions can compromise consciousness, swallowing, and respiration and require close monitoring Specialist stroke or neurology care improves outcomes and facilitates rapid completion of investigations Early input from physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy reduces disability\n\n*   **Treatment:** Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 300 mg loading followed by 75 mg daily (or clopidogrel if aspirin-intolerant)\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Should be commenced once neuroimaging confirms an ischaemic, non-haemorrhagic lesion Indicated for secondary prevention if a midbrain infarct is the established diagnosis\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-intensity statin therapy such as atorvastatin 80 mg daily\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Strongly recommended for secondary prevention after presumed ischaemic stroke Can be initiated while awaiting detailed aetiological workup provided baseline liver function tests are acceptable\n\n*   **Treatment:** Optimisation of blood pressure with antihypertensive therapy and lifestyle modification\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Hypertension is a major modifiable risk factor for recurrent cerebrovascular events Blood pressure control can be initiated concurrently with investigations\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone for 3\u20135 days followed by an oral steroid taper if demyelinating disease or optic neuritis is confirmed\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Immunosuppression should only be started once MRI and CSF findings support demyelination and infection has been excluded Unnecessary steroids may worsen occult infection or complicate stroke recovery\n\n*   **Treatment:** Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with intermittent pneumatic compression and low-molecular-weight heparin\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Right-sided weakness and gait instability increase risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism Mechanical prophylaxis can start immediately, with pharmacological prophylaxis added once intracranial haemorrhage is excluded on imaging\n\n*   **Treatment:** Physiotherapy and occupational therapy focused on gait, balance, and right-sided weakness\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Early rehabilitation improves functional recovery after brainstem lesions Targeted exercises help compensate for cerebellar ataxia and pyramidal weakness, reducing fall risk\n\n*   **Treatment:** Referral to ophthalmology for management of left optic neuropathy and third nerve palsy, including consideration of prisms or occlusion for diplopia\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Visual impairment and diplopia significantly impair function and safety Baseline ophthalmic assessment is necessary to monitor recovery and guide longer-term interventions such as ptosis surgery if needed\n\n*   **Treatment:** Oral anticoagulation if a cardioembolic source such as atrial fibrillation is identified\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Requires confirmation of a cardioembolic source on ECG and echocardiography Timing and choice of anticoagulant depend on infarct size and presence of haemorrhagic transformation on imaging\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"Admission to stroke or neurology unit with close neurological observations and early multidisciplinary rehabilitation\",
