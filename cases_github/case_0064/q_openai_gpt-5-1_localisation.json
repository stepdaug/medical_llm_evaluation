    "response": "A young man has complete right oculomotor palsy with ipsilateral ptosis and anisocoria, plus torsional nystagmus, together with contralateral (left) spastic hemiparesis, hyperreflexia with Babinski, contralateral limb ataxia and mainly contralateral sensory loss, giving a crossed brainstem syndrome best localised to a single right midbrain lesion involving the oculomotor fascicle, cerebral peduncle and cerebellar outflow pathways (Benedikt-type pattern). The separate right relative afferent pupillary defect with reduced visual acuity localises to an additional lesion in the right optic nerve.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"right midbrain\", \"right optic nerve\"]"
