    "response": "Left-sided spastic hemiparesis with brisk reflexes and extensor plantar response, together with right Horner's syndrome, right palatal and tongue weakness, gaze-evoked nystagmus and predominantly right-sided limb ataxia, indicates a crossed brainstem syndrome. Sparing of facial motor function (V, VII) localises the lesion below the pons, while involvement of nucleus ambiguus (IX/X), hypoglossal fascicle (XII), inferior cerebellar connections and descending sympathetic fibres is characteristic of a single right hemimedullary lesion in the medulla oblongata affecting both medial and lateral structures.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"right medulla oblongata\"]"
