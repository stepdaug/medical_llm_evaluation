    "response": "Right reduced visual acuity with a right relative afferent pupillary defect localises to a lesion in the right optic nerve anterior to the chiasm. Isolated left upper-limb dysmetria with normal tone, power, sensation, gait, and eye movements localises to the ipsilateral left cerebellar hemisphere (upper-limb representation) or its peduncular connections, without evidence of brainstem or cerebral involvement. The most parsimonious explanation is two discrete CNS lesions.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"right optic nerve\", \"left cerebellar hemisphere\"]"
