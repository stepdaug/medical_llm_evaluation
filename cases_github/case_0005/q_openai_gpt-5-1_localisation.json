    "response": "Unilateral left relative afferent pupillary defect with reduced visual acuity localises to the left optic nerve. Ipsilateral (right) limb dysmetria in arm and leg, gait ataxia, dysdiadochokinesia, rebound nystagmus, and normal power, tone, reflexes, and sensation indicate a right cerebellar hemispheric lesion. These two lesions, both within CNS white matter pathways, are the minimum needed to explain the findings.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"left optic nerve\", \"right cerebellar hemisphere\"]"
