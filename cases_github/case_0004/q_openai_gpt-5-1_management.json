    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** Admit to high-dependency neurology or neurosurgical unit with close monitoring of respiratory function, swallowing and neurological status\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Brainstem and upper cervical cord involvement can deteriorate rapidly and threaten ventilation Bulbar cranial nerve signs and unsteady gait increase risk of aspiration and falls\n\n*   **Treatment:** Speech and swallow assessment with implementation of appropriate diet modification and aspiration precautions\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Palatal and tongue weakness indicate bulbar dysfunction Early assessment reduces risk of aspiration pneumonia\n\n*   **Treatment:** Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with graduated compression stockings and low molecular weight heparin unless contraindicated\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Spastic quadriparesis and impaired mobility markedly increase thromboembolic risk Prophylaxis reduces morbidity from deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism\n\n*   **Treatment:** Early neurosurgical consultation for consideration of decompression or resection if MRI confirms a structural cervicomedullary mass\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Definitive structural diagnosis is required from MRI before planning surgery Timely decompression may reverse long-tract dysfunction and prevent further deterioration\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone followed by an oral steroid taper if imaging and CSF support an inflammatory demyelinating lesion\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Steroids are first-line acute therapy for inflammatory demyelinating lesions of the brainstem and cervical cord Empirical steroids should be avoided until infection and tumour have been reasonably excluded\n\n*   **Treatment:** Physiotherapy and occupational therapy for gait training, balance work and spasticity management\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Rehabilitation is essential for maximising functional recovery once the acute phase is stabilised Regular stretching and strengthening help prevent contractures and improve safety with mobility\n\n*   **Treatment:** Symptomatic treatment of spasticity with agents such as oral baclofen or tizanidine\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Generalised spasticity contributes to gait impairment and discomfort Spasticity medication is best introduced after underlying diagnosis and renal/hepatic function are clarified\n\n*   **Treatment:** Initiation of disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis if diagnostic criteria are fulfilled\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Long-term immunomodulatory treatment reduces relapse frequency and disability progression in confirmed multiple sclerosis Should only be started after robust diagnostic confirmation and counselling regarding risks and benefits\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"Admit to high-dependency neurology or neurosurgical unit with
