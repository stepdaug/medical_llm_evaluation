    "response": "The patient presents with distinct clinical signs affecting two separate areas of the nervous system (dissemination in space). Firstly, the Right Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect (RAPD) indicates a lesion of the Right Optic Nerve, despite the subjective complaint referring to the left eye. Secondly, the motor and sensory findings in the lower limbs are characteristic of Brown-S\u00e9quard syndrome (hemicord lesion). The presence of ipsilateral (right) upper motor neuron weakness (spasticity, hyperreflexia, extensor plantar) and ipsilateral loss of dorsal column modalities (vibration/proprioception), combined with contralateral (left) impairment of spinothalamic modalities (pinprick/temperature), localises the lesion to the right side of the spinal cord. As the upper limbs are spared (normal power and reflexes), the lesion must be below the T1 level.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Right Optic Nerve\", \"Right Thoracic Spinal Cord\"]"
