    "response": "Right relative afferent pupillary defect and reduced visual acuity with preserved eye movements localise to a prechiasmal lesion in the right optic nerve. Ipsilateral limb dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesia in the left arm, gait ataxia, and gaze-evoked nystagmus with normal power, reflexes, and sensation localise to the left cerebellar hemisphere; the absence of additional brainstem or long-tract signs supports separate optic and cerebellar lesions.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Right optic nerve\", \"Left cerebellar hemisphere\"]"
