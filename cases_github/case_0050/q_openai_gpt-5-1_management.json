    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\u20135 days followed by a short oral prednisolone taper\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Typical clinical picture of acute unilateral optic neuritis in a young adult High-dose corticosteroids shorten time to visual recovery in demyelinating optic neuritis No clinical evidence of uncontrolled systemic infection or contraindications to steroids\n\n*   **Treatment:** Proton pump inhibitor for gastric protection during corticosteroid therapy\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** High-dose corticosteroids increase risk of gastrointestinal irritation and ulceration Prophylaxis is recommended during several days of intravenous and oral steroid treatment\n\n*   **Treatment:** Empirical antibiotic therapy tailored to suspected bacterial pneumonia\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Chest X-ray shows lung consolidation that may represent bacterial infection Any active infection should be treated promptly, particularly before and during high-dose immunosuppression\n\n*   **Treatment:** Initiation of disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis if diagnostic criteria are met\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Requires confirmation of multiple sclerosis based on MRI and cerebrospinal fluid findings Choice of agent depends on lesion burden, prognostic factors and patient preferences Typically commenced after completion of acute relapse treatment\n\n*   **Treatment:** Plasma exchange\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Reserved for severe optic neuritis with poor response to high-dose steroids Particularly indicated in aquaporin-4 antibody-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder or severe MOG-associated attacks Consider if vision fails to improve within 1\u20132 weeks after steroid therapy\n\n*   **Treatment:** Vitamin D supplementation to maintain serum levels in the high-normal range\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Low vitamin D status is associated with increased risk and activity of multiple sclerosis Can be safely instituted after baseline vitamin D measurement\n\n*   **Treatment:** Ophthalmology and neuro-ophthalmology follow-up with visual rehabilitation advice\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Required to monitor visual acuity and field recovery and detect complications Provides patient counselling regarding prognosis, driving, and occupational implications Facilitates early detection of relapse or treatment failure\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3\\u20135 days followed by a short
