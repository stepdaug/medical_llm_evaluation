    "response": "Left lower-limb spasticity with pyramidal-pattern weakness, brisk knee and ankle reflexes and an extensor plantar response, with normal cranial nerves and upper limbs, indicates an upper motor neuron lesion affecting pathways to the leg below the cervical enlargement. A positive Romberg sign and impaired distal proprioception/vibration in the legs imply dorsal column involvement. Together this is best explained by a single partial hemicord lesion in the left thoracic spinal cord.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"left thoracic spinal cord\"]"
