    "response": "My clinical reasoning is based on integrating the various neurological deficits to pinpoint the lesion locations. The patient's right-sided weakness, spasticity, hyperreflexia, and upgoing plantar reflex are classic upper motor neuron signs, indicating a lesion in the left central nervous system. This is accompanied by right-sided sensory loss and right-sided appendicular ataxia. The combination of a contralateral hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, and hemiataxia with an ipsilateral cranial nerve palsy is characteristic of a brainstem lesion. Specifically, the left oculomotor (CN III) palsy (ptosis, mydriasis, and impaired adduction/elevation/depression of the eye) localizes this lesion to the left midbrain, where the CN III nucleus and fascicles reside in close proximity to the corticospinal tract, sensory pathways, and cerebellar outflow tracts (e.g., red nucleus).\n\nSeparately, the findings of reduced visual acuity (6/36) and a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) in the left eye are pathognomonic for a left optic neuropathy. This lesion must be located in the left optic nerve, anterior to the optic chiasm, and cannot be explained by the midbrain lesion. Therefore, the clinical presentation is best explained by two distinct lesions in the central nervous system.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Left Midbrain\", \"Left Optic Nerve\"]",
