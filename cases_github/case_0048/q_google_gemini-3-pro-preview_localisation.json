    "response": "The patient presents with a classic Right Brown-S\u00e9quard syndrome, characterised by right-sided upper motor neuron weakness (spasticity, pyramidal weakness, hyperreflexia, extensor plantar response) and right-sided dorsal column loss (reduced vibration/proprioception), with contralateral (left-sided) spinothalamic loss (reduced pinprick). This localises to a right hemicord lesion. Since the upper limbs are spared, the lesion is in the thoracic spinal cord. Additionally, the patient exhibits right upper limb ataxia, dysdiadochokinesia, and downbeat nystagmus, which cannot be explained by the spinal lesion. These signs localise to the right cerebellum and vestibulocerebellum. The presence of two distinct anatomical lesions indicates dissemination in space.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Right Thoracic Spinal Cord\", \"Right Cerebellum\"]"
