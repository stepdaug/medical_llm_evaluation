    "response": "My clinical reasoning is based on identifying multiple, spatially distinct lesions within the central nervous system, which is a hallmark of a demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis.\n\nFirst, the combination of reduced visual acuity (6/18), a \"smudge-like\" visual disturbance, and a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) on the left side localises definitively to a lesion of the left optic nerve. This is characteristic of optic neuritis.\n\nSecond, there are upper motor neuron (UMN) signs affecting the left side of the body. Specifically, the brisk triceps and knee reflexes (3+) on the left, in the context of at least some mild weakness (wrist extension 4+/5), point to a lesion affecting the corticospinal tract that supplies the left side. As this tract originates in the right motor cortex and crosses in the medulla, the lesion must be located above the decussation, for instance, in the white matter of the right cerebral hemisphere.\n\nThird, there is also subtle weakness (4+/5) noted in the right upper limb (shoulder abduction, elbow flexion, first dorsal interosseous). This suggests an additional, separate lesion affecting the corticospinal pathways on the left side, likely within the left cerebral hemisphere.\n\nThe presence of at least three distinct neurological lesions (left optic nerve, right cerebral hemisphere, left cerebral hemisphere) explains the patient's multifocal examination findings.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Left Optic Nerve\", \"Right Cerebral Hemisphere\", \"Left Cerebral Hemisphere\"]",
