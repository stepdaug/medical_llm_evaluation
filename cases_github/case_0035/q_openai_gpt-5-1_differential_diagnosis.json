    "response": "A subacute (days) onset crossed brainstem syndrome in a 41-year-old without systemic inflammatory features is most suggestive of a demyelinating brainstem plaque or a small-vessel/embolic ischaemic pontine infarct. The normal systemic examination and age make intrinsic tumour or cavernoma with small haemorrhage less likely but important structural alternatives. Chronic granulomatous or vasculitic processes such as neurosarcoidosis are rarer considerations.\n\ndifferential_diagnosis = [\"Multiple sclerosis with left pontine demyelinating plaque\", \"Left pontine ischaemic stroke (vertebrobasilar territory)\", \"Left pontine cavernous malformation with recent haemorrhage\", \"Intrinsic pontine glioma (brainstem astrocytoma)\", \"Neurosarcoidosis involving the pons\"]"
