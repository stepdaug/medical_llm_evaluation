    "response": "MRI is urgent to visualize demyelinating plaques and confirm dissemination in space/time. CSF analysis is required to detect oligoclonal bands (supporting MS) and exclude infection. Antibody testing (AQP4, MOG) is essential to rule out MS mimics which require different management. Screening for infection is necessary given the urinalysis findings, as concurrent infection can trigger or mimic relapses.\n\ninvestigations = [\"MRI Brain and Whole Spine with Gadolinium\", \"Lumbar Puncture (CSF for cell count, protein, glucose, oligoclonal bands, culture)\", \"Serum AQP4 antibodies\", \"Serum MOG antibodies\", \"Full blood count\", \"Urea and electrolytes\", \"C-reactive protein\", \"Liver function tests\", \"Autoimmune screen (ANA, ENA, ANCA)\", \"Urinalysis and Urine Culture\", \"Visual Evoked Potentials (VEP)\"]"
