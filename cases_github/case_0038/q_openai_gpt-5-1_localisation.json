    "response": "There is a partial left oculomotor palsy (ptosis, anisocoria, complex ophthalmoplegia, vertical downbeat nystagmus) with preserved facial strength, together with right-sided spastic hemiparesis (brisk reflexes, clonus, extensor plantar) and right appendicular and gait ataxia (dysmetria, intention tremor, unsteady tandem gait). This ipsilateral cranial nerve III deficit with contralateral pyramidal and cerebellar signs is best explained by a single lesion involving the left midbrain tegmentum and adjacent cerebral peduncle affecting the oculomotor fascicle, corticospinal tract, and decussated superior cerebellar peduncle/red nucleus pathways.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"left midbrain\"]"
