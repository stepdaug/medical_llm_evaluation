    "response": "The patient presents with multifocal neurological deficits. The left-sided blindness with No Perception of Light (NPL) and a Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect (RAPD) localises unequivocally to the left pre-chiasmal optic nerve. The constellation of gait ataxia, left-sided dysmetria, left dysdiadochokinesia, and gaze-evoked nystagmus localises to the left cerebellum. The presence of spatially distinct lesions (supratentorial/anterior visual pathway and infratentorial) indicates a multifocal process, likely demyelinating.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Left Optic Nerve\", \"Left Cerebellar Hemisphere\"]"
