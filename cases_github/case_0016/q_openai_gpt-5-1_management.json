    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** No\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** Admission to a neurology ward for monitoring and expedited diagnostic workup\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Patient has significant brainstem signs including ophthalmoplegia and spastic quadriparesis Close observation is needed in case of neurological deterioration Inpatient setting facilitates rapid MRI, lumbar puncture and allied assessments\n\n*   **Treatment:** Physiotherapy and occupational therapy for gait, balance training and activities of daily living\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Documented gait unsteadiness and tandem gait instability Bilateral limb ataxia and weakness impair mobility and function Early rehabilitation improves functional outcome and reduces falls\n\n*   **Treatment:** Fall prevention strategies and provision of appropriate mobility aids\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Romberg is abnormal with eyes open and tandem gait is unstable Intention tremor and dysmetria increase risk of falls Environmental and assistive measures can immediately reduce injury risk\n\n*   **Treatment:** Spasticity management with oral baclofen (or alternative agent) plus stretching programme\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Examination shows spasticity in all four limbs with brisk reflexes and clonus Spasticity can cause discomfort and limit rehabilitation Early pharmacologic and physical management can improve mobility and prevent contractures\n\n*   **Treatment:** Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin and mechanical compression if mobility is reduced\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Spastic quadriparesis and gait ataxia may significantly limit ambulation Obesity and middle age increase thromboembolic risk Prophylaxis is indicated in neurologically impaired inpatients without contraindications\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (for example 1 g daily for 3\u20135 days) followed by an oral taper if an inflammatory demyelinating brainstem lesion is confirmed\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Steroid therapy should be reserved until MRI and CSF support a demyelinating or autoimmune process Premature steroids could obscure diagnosis or worsen occult infection or neoplasm Evidence supports corticosteroids to hasten recovery in acute demyelinating relapses\n\n*   **Treatment:** Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel if an ischaemic midbrain stroke is diagnosed\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Antiplatelets are indicated for secondary prevention after non-cardioembolic ischaemic stroke They should be avoided until haemorrhage, cavernoma or tumour are excluded on imaging Definitive vascular diagnosis is needed to balance benefits and bleeding risk\n\n*   **Treatment:** High-intensity statin therapy if imaging confirms an ischaemic event or significant atherosclerotic disease\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Statins reduce risk of recurrent cerebrovascular events Unnecessary statin therapy can be avoided if no vascular pathology is found Baseline liver function and overall vascular risk profile should guide initiation\n\n*   **Treatment:** Neurosurgical and oncology consultation for consideration of biopsy, resection or radiotherapy if a midbrain tumour or cavernous malformation is identified\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Definitive management of intrinsic brainstem lesions depends on detailed MRI findings Surgical or radiosurgical intervention carries substantial risk and must be carefully planned Consultation is only appropriate once a structural lesion is clearly demonstrated\n\n*   **Treatment:** Initiation of disease-modifying therapy for multiple sclerosis if diagnostic criteria are fulfilled\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Disease-modifying therapies require firm diagnosis and evaluation of disease phenotype and activity Baseline infectious, hepatic and haematological screening must be completed first Choice of agent (e.g., ocrelizumab or other) depends on individual risk\u2013benefit assessment\n\n*   **Treatment:** Lifestyle and vascular risk-factor modification including blood pressure optimisation, weight management and smoking cessation support if applicable\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Patient has hypertension, obesity and NAFLD, which increase vascular risk regardless of final diagnosis Improved vascular health benefits potential stroke outcomes and overall prognosis Non-pharmacological measures can be initiated safely while diagnostic workup proceeds\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"Admission to a neurology ward for monitoring and expedited
