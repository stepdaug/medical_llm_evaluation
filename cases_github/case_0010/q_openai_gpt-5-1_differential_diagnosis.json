    "response": "A subacute optic neuropathy in one eye plus anatomically separate signs of a central sensorimotor lesion in a middle-aged adult strongly suggest an inflammatory demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis; neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and MOG-antibody\u2013associated disease are important alternatives. Structural brain lesions in the left parasagittal region (tumour, meningioma, cavernoma or ACA-territory infarct) can mimic the leg-predominant weakness pattern. Given diabetes and age, non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy is a vascular alternative for the optic nerve involvement, while metabolic myelopathies such as B12 deficiency and coexisting diabetic polyneuropathy could contribute to sensory ataxia.\n\ndifferential_diagnosis = [\"Relapsing\\u2013remitting multiple sclerosis\", \"Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder\", \"MOG antibody\\u2013associated disease\", \"Left parasagittal meningioma or other space-occupying lesion compressing the medial frontal and parietal lobes\", \"Anterior cerebral artery territory infarct affecting parasagittal frontoparietal cortex\", \"Non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy of the right eye\", \"Subacute combined degeneration of the cord due to vitamin B12 deficiency\", \"Diabetic length-dependent peripheral polyneuropathy\"]"
