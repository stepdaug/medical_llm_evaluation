    "response": "**Overall Treatment Decision:** Yes\n\n**Specific Treatment Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Treatment:** Intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3 days followed by a short oral prednisolone taper\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** High-dose corticosteroids accelerate visual recovery in acute optic neuritis Early treatment may reduce severity of potential NMOSD or MOGAD-related attacks Clinical picture does not suggest active systemic infection, making steroids relatively safe while further tests are performed\n\n*   **Treatment:** Proton pump inhibitor prophylaxis while receiving high-dose corticosteroids\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Reduces risk of steroid-induced gastritis and peptic ulceration Standard co-therapy with short-term high-dose systemic steroids in adults\n\n*   **Treatment:** Urgent ophthalmology and neuro-ophthalmology assessment\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Confirms optic nerve involvement and excludes primary retinal or ocular pathology Provides baseline visual acuity, colour vision and field measurements to monitor treatment response\n\n*   **Treatment:** Simple analgesia (e.g., paracetamol) for periocular discomfort if present\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Start Now\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Optic neuritis commonly causes eye pain, and simple analgesia improves comfort Does not interfere with diagnostic investigations or immunotherapy\n\n*   **Treatment:** Initiation of multiple sclerosis disease-modifying therapy if MRI and CSF fulfil diagnostic criteria\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Requires confirmation of dissemination in time and space according to current MS diagnostic criteria Choice of agent depends on lesion burden, prognostic markers, comorbidities and patient preference\n\n*   **Treatment:** Long-term immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., rituximab, azathioprine, mycophenolate) if NMOSD, MOGAD or systemic autoimmune disease is confirmed\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Specific regimen depends on antibody status and systemic involvement Requires baseline infection screening, vaccination review and multidisciplinary planning\n\n*   **Treatment:** Targeted treatment of right upper lobe airspace disease after respiratory evaluation\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Further characterisation with CT chest and possibly bronchoscopy or biopsy is needed to distinguish infection from sarcoidosis or other interstitial lung disease Definitive therapy (e.g., antibiotics versus additional immunosuppression) depends on the final pulmonary diagnosis\n\n*   **Treatment:** Vitamin D supplementation and lifestyle counselling if deficiency is confirmed\n*   **Initiation Timing:** Delay\n*   **Clinical Reasoning for Timing:** Low vitamin D is associated with increased risk and relapse rate in demyelinating disease Supplementation should be guided by measured vitamin D levels to avoid toxicity\n\n\ntreatments = [{\"treatment\": \"Intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3 days followed by a short oral prednisolone taper\", \"timing\": \"Start Now\", \"reasons\": [\"High-dose
