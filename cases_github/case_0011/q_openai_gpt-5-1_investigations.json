    "response": "Urgent MRI is needed to confirm the left midbrain lesion, characterise its nature (demyelinating vs vascular vs neoplastic) and assess the optic nerve. CSF and serological studies help distinguish multiple sclerosis from NMO/MOG and other inflammatory or infectious causes. Vascular imaging evaluates for stroke or aneurysm. Ancillary tests document visual pathway damage and screen for systemic disease and treatment contraindications.\n\ninvestigations = [\"MRI of brain and orbits with gadolinium contrast\", \"MRI of whole spine with gadolinium contrast\", \"MR angiogram of intracranial and neck vessels\", \"Visual evoked potentials\", \"Optical coherence tomography of retinal nerve fibre layer\", \"Lumbar puncture for CSF cell count and differential\", \"Lumbar puncture for CSF protein and glucose\", \"Lumbar puncture for CSF oligoclonal bands and IgG index\", \"Lumbar puncture for CSF microbiology and viral PCR as indicated\", \"Full blood count\", \"Urea and electrolytes\", \"Liver function tests\", \"C-reactive protein\", \"Erythrocyte sedimentation rate\", \"Coagulation screen\", \"Blood glucose\", \"Lipid profile\", \"Vitamin B12 level\", \"Serum folate level\", \"Thyroid function tests\", \"Serum ACE level\", \"Antinuclear antibody\", \"Extractable nuclear antigen antibody panel\", \"Anti-double-stranded DNA antibody\", \"ANCA (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies)\", \"Serum aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody\", \"Serum MOG (myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein) antibody\", \"HIV serology\", \"Syphilis serology\", \"Lyme disease serology (if epidemiologically indicated)\", \"Electrocardiogram\", \"Chest X-ray\"]"
