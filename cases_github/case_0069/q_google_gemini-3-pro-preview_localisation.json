    "response": "The patient exhibits a right-sided upper motor neuron hemiparesis (spasticity, hyperreflexia, weakness) and right-sided loss of dorsal column modalities (vibration and proprioception), with sparing of the spinothalamic modality (pinprick) and cranial nerves (face spared). The brisk reflexes in the right upper limb (biceps, triceps) place the lesion above the C5 segment. The right-sided miosis (smaller pupil) may indicate interruption of the descending sympathetic fibers (partial Horner's syndrome). This constellation of ipsilateral motor and dorsal column deficits is characteristic of a hemicord or posterior cord lesion.\n\nlesion_locations = [\"Right Cervical Spinal Cord\"]"
